<p>In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than nonmagical armor. Magic armor bonuses are enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and stack with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield enhancement bonuses). All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check penalties by 1.</p>
<p>In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. A suit of armor cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A suit of armor with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
<p>A suit of armor or a shield may be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01-95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96-100 indicates that it is made of a special material.</p>
<p>Armor is always created so that even if the type of armor comes with boots or gauntlets, these pieces can be switched for other magic boots or gauntlets.</p>

<p>| All magic shields are masterwork shields (with an armor check penalty 1 less than normal). | |  |</p>
<p><strong>Caster Level for Armor and Shields:</strong> The caster level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>
<p><strong>Shields:</strong> Shield enhancement bonuses stack with armor enhancement bonuses. Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as attack or damage bonuses when the shield is used in a bash. The bashing special ability, however, does grant a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls (see the special ability description).</p>
<p>A shield could be built that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to AC.</p>
<p>As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not improve AC. A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Shield Hardness and Hit Points:</strong> Each +1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to a shield's hardness and +10 to its hit points.</p>
<p><strong>Activation:</strong> Usually a character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields--by wearing them. If armor or a shield has a special ability that the user needs to activate then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a standard action).</p>
<p><strong>Armor for Unusual Creatures:</strong> The cost of armor for nonhumanoid creatures, as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies. The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.</p>

<p>Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have one or more of the special abilities detailed below. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Acid Resistance:</strong> A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a dull gray appearance. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of acid damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Acid Resistance, Improved:</strong> As acid resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of acid damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Acid Resistance, Greater:</strong> As acid resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of acid damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Animated:</strong> Upon command, an animated shield floats within 2 feet of the wielder, protecting her as if she were using it herself but freeing up both her hands. Only one shield can protect a character at a time. A character with an animated shield still takes any penalties associated with shield use, such as armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, and nonproficiency.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects; Price +2 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Arrow Catching:</strong> A shield with this ability attracts ranged weapons to it. It has a deflection bonus of +1 against ranged weapons because projectiles and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon aimed at a target within 5 feet of the shield's wearer diverts from its original target and targets the shield's bearer instead. (If the wielder has total cover relative to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted.) Additionally, those attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that would normally apply. Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher than the shield's base AC bonus are not diverted to the wearer (but the shield's increased AC bonus still applies against these weapons). The wielder can activate or deactivate this ability with a command word.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, entropic shield; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Arrow Deflection:</strong> This shield protects the wielder as if he had the Deflect Arrows feat. Once per round when he would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he can make a DC 20 Reflex save. If the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. He must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or acid arrows, can't be deflected.</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shield; Price +2 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Bashing:</strong> A shield with this special ability is designed to perform a shield bash. A bashing shield deals damage as if it were a weapon of two size categories larger (a Medium light shield thus deals 1d6 points of damage and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d8 points of damage). The shield acts as a +1 weapon when used to bash. (Only light and heavy shields can have this ability.)</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bull's strength; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Blinding:</strong> A shield with this ability flashes with a brilliant light up to twice per day upon command of the wielder. Anyone within 20 feet except the wielder must make a DC 14 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, searing light; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Resistance:</strong> A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a bluish, icy hue or is adorned with furs and shaggy pelts. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of cold damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Resistance, Improved:</strong> As cold resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of cold damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Resistance, Greater:</strong> As cold resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of cold damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Electricity Resistance:</strong> A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a bluish hue and often bears a storm or lightning motif. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of electricity damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Electricity Resistance, Improved:</strong> As electricity resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of electricity damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Electricity Resistance, Greater:</strong> As electricity resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of electricity damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Etherealness:</strong> On command, this ability allows the wearer of the armor to become ethereal (as the ethereal jaunt spell) once per day. The character can remain ethereal for as long as desired, but once he returns to normal, he cannot become ethereal again that day.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, ethereal jaunt; Price +49,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Resistance:</strong> A suit of armor with this ability normally has a reddish hue and often is decorated with a draconic motif. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of fire damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Resistance, Improved:</strong> As fire resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of fire damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Resistance, Greater:</strong> As fire resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of fire damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Fortification:</strong> This suit of armor or shield produces a magical force that protects vital areas of the wearer more effectively. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the wearer, there is a chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.</p>
<p>| Fortification Type | | Chance for Normal Damage | | Base Price Modifier | |  |
| Light | | 25% | | +1 bonus | |  |
| Moderate | | 75% | | +3 bonus | |  |
| Heavy | | 100% | | +5 bonus | |  |</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, limited wish or miracle; Price varies (see above).</p>
<p><strong>Ghost Touch:</strong> This armor or shield seems almost translucent. Both its enhancement bonus and its armor bonus count against the attacks of incorporeal creatures. It can be picked up, moved, and worn by incorporeal creatures at any time. Incorporeal creatures gain the armor or shield's enhancement bonus against both corporeal and incorporeal attacks, and they can still pass freely through solid objects.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, etherealness; Price +3 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Glamered:</strong> A suit of armor with this ability appears normal. Upon command, the armor changes shape and form to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing. The armor retains all its properties (including weight) when glamered. Only a true seeing spell or similar magic reveals the true nature of the armor when disguised.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, disguise self; Price +2,700 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Invulnerability:</strong> This suit of armor grants the wearer damage reduction of 5/magic.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration and perhaps evocation (if miracle is used); CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, stoneskin, wish or miracle; Price +3 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Reflecting:</strong> This shield seems like a mirror. Its surface is completely reflective. Once per day, it can be called on to reflect a spell back at its caster exactly like the spell turning spell.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, spell turning; Price +5 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow:</strong> This armor is jet black and blurs the wearer whenever she tries to hide, granting a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks. (The armor's armor check penalty still applies normally.)</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, invisibility; Price +3,750 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow, Improved:</strong> As shadow, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Hide checks.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, invisibility; Price +15,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow, Greater:</strong> As shadow, except it grants a +15 competence bonus on Hide checks.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, invisibility; Price +33,750 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Silent Moves:</strong> This armor is well oiled and magically constructed so that it not only makes little sound, but it dampens sound around it. It provides a +5 competence bonus on its wearer's Move Silently checks. (The armor's armor check penalty still applies normally.)</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, silence; Price +3,750 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Silent Moves, Improved:</strong> As silent moves, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Move Silently checks.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, silence; Price +15,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Silent Moves, Greater:</strong> As silent moves, except it grants a +15 competence bonus on Move Silently checks.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, silence; Price +33,750 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Slick:</strong> Slick armor seems coated at all times with a slightly greasy oil. It provides a +5 competence bonus on its wearer's Escape Artist checks. (The armor's armor check penalty still applies normally.)</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 4th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, grease; Price +3,750 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Slick, Improved:</strong> As slick, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, grease; Price +15,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Slick, Greater:</strong> As slick, except it grants a +15 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, grease; Price +33,750 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Sonic Resistance:</strong> A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a glistening appearance. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of sonic damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Sonic Resistance, Improved:</strong> As sonic resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of sonic damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Sonic Resistance, Greater:</strong> As sonic resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of sonic damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> This property grants the armor's wearer spell resistance while the armor is worn. The spell resistance can be 13, 15, 17, or 19, depending on the armor.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, spell resistance; Price +2 bonus (SR 13), +3 bonus (SR 15), +4 bonus (SR 17), or +5 bonus (SR 19).</p>
<p><strong>Undead Controlling:</strong> The wearer of a suit of armor or a shield with this property may control up to 26 HD of undead per day, as the control undead spell. At dawn each day, the wearer loses control of any undead still under his sway. Armor or a shield with this ability appears to be made of bone; this feature is entirely decorative and has no other effect on the armor.</p>
<p>Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, control undead; Price +49,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Wild:</strong> The wearer of a suit of armor or a shield with this ability preserves his armor bonus (and any enhancement bonus) while in a wild shape. Armor and shields with this ability usually appear to be made covered in leaf patterns. While the wearer is in a wild shape, the armor cannot be seen.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, baleful polymorph; Price +3 bonus.</p>

<p>The following specific suits of armor usually are preconstructed with exactly the qualities described here.</p>
<p><strong>Adamantine Breastplate:</strong> This nonmagical breastplate is made of adamantine, giving its wearer damage reduction of 2/-.</p>
<p>No aura (nonmagical); Price 10,200 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Banded Mail of Luck:</strong> Ten 100-gp gems adorn this +3 banded mail. Once per week, the armor allows its wearer to require that an attack roll made against him be rerolled. He must take whatever consequences come from the second roll. The wearer's player must decide whether to have the attack roll rerolled before damage is rolled.</p>
<p>Strong enchantment; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bless; Price 18,900 gp; Cost 10,150 gp + 700 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Breastplate of Command:</strong> This finely crafted +2 breastplate radiates a powerful aura of magic. When worn, the armor bestows a dignified and commanding aura upon its owner. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma checks, including turning checks and Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus to his Leadership score. Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal. Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the armor, the wearer cannot hide or conceal herself in any way and still have the effect function.</p>
<p>Strong enchantment; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, mass charm monster; Price 25,400 gp; Cost 10,975 gp + 850 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Celestial Armor:</strong> This bright silver or gold +3 chainmail is so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without betraying its presence. It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +8, an armor check penalty of -2, and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%. It is considered light armor, weighs 20 pounds, and it allows the wearer to use fly on command (as the spell) once per day.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation [good]; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be good, fly; Price 22,400 gp; Cost 12,550 gp + 1,004 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Demon Armor:</strong> This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon. The helmet is shaped to look like a horned demon head, and its wearer looks out of the open, tooth-filled mouth. This +4 full plate allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a contagion spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The &quot;claws&quot; are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets. </p>
