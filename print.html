The bulk of the conversion work was done programmatically.
After that, fixes were applied by hand.</p>
<p>While the content is organized into more pages than the base RTF files,
there are not any <em>intentional</em> rules differences between this markdown version and the official RTF version.
However, typos and errors are always possible.</p>

<p><strong>The Core Mechanic:</strong> Whenever you attempt an action that has some chance of failure, you roll a twenty-sided die (d20). To determine if your character succeeds at a task you do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll a d20.</li>
<li>Add any relevant modifiers.</li>
<li>Compare the result to a target number.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the result equals or exceeds the target number, your character succeeds. If the result is lower than the target number, you fail.</p>
<h2 id="dice"><a class="header" href="#dice">Dice</a></h2>
<p>Dice rolls are described with expressions such as &quot;3d4+3,&quot; which means &quot;roll three four-sided dice and add 3&quot; (resulting in a number between 6 and 15). The first number tells you how many dice to roll (adding the results together). The number immediately after the &quot;d&quot; tells you the type of die to use. Any number after that indicates a quantity that is added or subtracted from the result.</p>
<p><strong>d%:</strong> Percentile dice work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before you roll) is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100.</p>
<h2 id="rounding-fractions"><a class="header" href="#rounding-fractions">Rounding Fractions</a></h2>
<p>In general, if you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the fraction is one-half or larger.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Certain rolls, such as damage and hit points, have a minimum of 1.</p>
<h2 id="multiplying"><a class="header" href="#multiplying">Multiplying</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes a rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll. As long as you're applying a single multiplier, multiply the number normally. When two or more multipliers apply to any abstract value (such as a modifier or a die roll), however, combine them into a single multiple, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. Thus, a double (x2) and a double (x2) applied to the same number results in a triple (x3, because 2 + 1 = 3).</p>
<p>When applying multipliers to real-world values (such as weight or distance), normal rules of math apply instead. A creature whose size doubles (thus multiplying its weight by 8) and then is turned to stone (which would multiply its weight by a factor of roughly 3) now weighs about 24 times normal, not 10 times normal. Similarly, a blinded creature attempting to negotiate difficult terrain would count each square as 4 squares (doubling the cost twice, for a total multiplier of x4), rather than as 3 squares (adding 100% twice). </p>
<h2 id="ability-scores"><a class="header" href="#ability-scores">Ability Scores</a></h2>
<h3 id="ability-modifiers"><a class="header" href="#ability-modifiers">Ability Modifiers</a></h3>
<p>Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging from -5 to +5. Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells shows the modifier for each score. It also shows bonus spells, which you'll need to know about if your character is a spellcaster.</p>
<p>The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren't die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty.</p>
<h4 id="table-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells"><a class="header" href="#table-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a></h4>
<p>Bonus Spell slots are listed by spell level.</p>
<p>A character never gains bonus 0th level slots.</p>
<p>If a character's ability score is 9 or less they cannot cast spells associated with that ability.</p>

<p>The ability that governs bonus spells depends on what type of spellcaster your character is: Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers; or Charisma for sorcerers and bards. In addition to having a high ability score, a spellcaster must be of high enough class level to be able to cast spells of a given spell level. (See the class descriptions for details.)</p>

<li>Melee attack rolls.</li>
<li>Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon (including a sling). (Exceptions: Off-hand attacks receive only one-half the character's Strength bonus, while two-handed attacks receive one and a half times the Strength bonus. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies to attacks made with a bow that is not a composite bow.)</li>
<li>Climb, Jump, and Swim checks. These are the skills that have Strength as their key ability.</li>
<li>Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dexterity-dex"><a class="header" href="#dexterity-dex">Dexterity (Dex)</a></h4>
<p>Dexterity measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is the most important one for rogues, but it's also high on the list for characters who typically wear light or medium armor (rangers and barbarians) or no armor at all (monks, wizards, and sorcerers), and for anyone who wants to be a skilled archer.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ranged attack rolls, including those for attacks made with bows, crossbows, throwing axes, and other ranged weapons.</li>
<li>Armor Class (AC), provided that the character can react to the attack.</li>
<li>Reflex saving throws, for avoiding fireballs and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly.</li>
<li>Balance, Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, Ride, Sleight of Hand, Tumble, and Use Rope checks. These are the skills that have Dexterity as their key ability.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="constitution-con"><a class="header" href="#constitution-con">Constitution (Con)</a></h4>
<p>Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, so the ability is important for all classes.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Constitution modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each roll of a Hit Die (though a penalty can never drop a result below 1--that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit point each time he or she advances in level).</li>
<li>Fortitude saving throws, for resisting poison and similar threats.</li>
<li>Concentration checks. Concentration is a skill, important to spellcasters, that has Constitution as its key ability.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a character's Constitution score changes enough to alter his or her Constitution modifier, the character's hit points also increase or decrease accordingly.</p>
<h4 id="intelligence-int"><a class="header" href="#intelligence-int">Intelligence (Int)</a></h4>
<p>Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This ability is important for wizards because it affects how many spells they can cast, how hard their spells are to resist, and how powerful their spells can be. It's also important for any character who wants to have a wide assortment of skills.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of languages your character knows at the start of the game.</li>
<li>The number of skill points gained each level. (But your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.)</li>
<li>Appraise, Craft, Decipher Script, Disable Device, Forgery, Knowledge, Search, and Spellcraft checks. These are the skills that have Intelligence as their key ability.</li>
</ul>
<p>A wizard gains bonus spells based on her Intelligence score. The minimum Intelligence score needed to cast a wizard spell is 10 + the spell's level. </p>
<p>An animal has an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. A creature of humanlike intelligence has a score of at least 3.</p>
<h4 id="wisdom-wis"><a class="header" href="#wisdom-wis">Wisdom (Wis)</a></h4>
<p>Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While Intelligence represents one's ability to analyze information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one's surroundings. Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and druids, and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will saving throws (for negating the effect of charm person and other spells).</li>
<li>Heal, Listen, Profession, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks. These are the skills that have Wisdom as their key ability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers get bonus spells based on their Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a cleric, druid, paladin, or ranger spell is 10 + the spell's level.</p>
<h4 id="charisma-cha"><a class="header" href="#charisma-cha">Charisma (Cha)</a></h4>
<p>Charisma measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social setting. Charisma is most important for paladins, sorcerers, and bards. It is also important for clerics, since it affects their ability to turn undead. Every creature has a Charisma score.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Gather Information, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Perform, and Use Magic Device checks. These are the skills that have Charisma as their key ability.</li>
<li>Checks that represent attempts to influence others. </li>
<li>Turning checks for clerics and paladins attempting to turn zombies, vampires, and other undead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorcerers and bards get bonus spells based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma score needed to cast a sorcerer or bard spell is 10 + the spell's level.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-changes"><a class="header" href="#ability-score-changes">Ability Score Changes</a></h3>
<p>When an ability score changes, all attributes associated with that score change accordingly. A character does not retroactively get additional skill points for previous levels if she increases her intelligence.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="races"><a class="header" href="#races">Races</a></h1>
<h2 id="favored-class"><a class="header" href="#favored-class">Favored Class</a></h2>
<p>A character's favored class doesn't count against him or her when determining experience point penalties for multiclassing. </p>
<h2 id="race-and-languages"><a class="header" href="#race-and-languages">Race and Languages</a></h2>
<p>All characters know how to speak Common. A dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, or halfling also speaks a racial language, as appropriate. A character who has an Intelligence bonus at 1st level speaks other languages as well, one extra language per point of Intelligence bonus as a starting character. </p>
<p><strong>Literacy:</strong> Any character except a barbarian can read and write all the languages he or she speaks.</p>
<p><strong>Class-Related Languages:</strong> Clerics, druids, and wizards can choose certain languages as bonus languages even if they're not on the lists found in the race descriptions. These class-related languages are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleric: Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal.</li>
<li>Druid: Sylvan.</li>
<li>Wizard: Draconic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="small-characters"><a class="header" href="#small-characters">Small Characters</a></h2>
<p>A Small character gets a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. A Small character's carrying capacity is three-quarters of that of a Medium character.</p>
<p>A Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as a Medium character.</p>
<p>A Small character must use smaller weapons than a Medium character.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dwarf"><a class="header" href="#dwarf">Dwarf</a></h1>

<li>
<p>Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such situations).</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Stonecunning:</strong> This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. </p>

<h2 id="arcane-spells-and-armor"><a class="header" href="#arcane-spells-and-armor">Arcane Spells And Armor</a></h2>
<p>Wizards and sorcerers do not know how to wear armor effectively.</p>
<p>If desired, they can wear armor anyway (though they'll be clumsy in it), or they can gain training in the proper use of armor (with the various Armor Proficiency feats--light, medium, and heavy--and the Shield Proficiency feat), or they can multiclass to add a class that grants them armor proficiency. Even if a wizard or sorcerer is wearing armor with which he or she is proficient, however, it might still interfere with spellcasting.</p>
<p>Armor restricts the complicated gestures that a wizards or sorcerer must make while casting any spell that has a somatic component (most do). The armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.</p>
<p>By contrast, bards not only know how to wear light armor effectively, but they can also ignore the arcane spell failure chance for such armor. A bard wearing armor heavier than light or using any type of shield incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance, even if he becomes proficient with that armor.</p>
<p>If a spell doesn't have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no problem while wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster's hands are bound or if he or she is grappling (although Concentration checks still apply normally). Also, the metamagic feat Still Spell allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell at one spell level higher than normal without the somatic component. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.</p>
<h2 id="multiclass-characters"><a class="header" href="#multiclass-characters">Multiclass Characters</a></h2>
<p>A character may add new classes as he or she progresses in level, thus becoming a multiclass character. The class abilities from a character's different classes combine to determine a multiclass character's overall abilities. Multiclassing improves a character's versatility at the expense of focus.</p>
<h3 id="class-and-level-features"><a class="header" href="#class-and-level-features">Class And Level Features</a></h3>
<p>As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum of the abilities of each of the character's classes.</p>
<p><strong>Level:</strong> &quot;Character level&quot; is a character's total number of levels. It is used to determine when feats and ability score boosts are gained.</p>
<p>&quot;Class level&quot; is a character's level in a particular class. For a character whose levels are all in the same class, character level and class level are the same.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> A character gains hit points from each class as his or her class level increases, adding the new hit points to the previous total. </p>
<p><strong>Base Attack Bonus:</strong> Add the base attack bonuses acquired for each class to get the character's base attack bonus. A resulting value of +6 or higher provides the character with multiple attacks. </p>
<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Add the base save bonuses for each class together.</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> If a skill is a class skill for any of a multiclass character's classes, then character level determines a skill's maximum rank. (The maximum rank for a class skill is 3 + character level.)</p>
<p>If a skill is not a class skill for any of a multiclass character's classes, the maximum rank for that skill is one-half the maximum for a class skill.</p>
<p><strong>Class Features:</strong> A multiclass character gets all the class features of all his or her classes but must also suffer the consequences of the special restrictions of all his or her classes. (Exception: A character who acquires the barbarian class does not become illiterate.) </p>
<p>In the special case of turning undead, both clerics and experienced paladins have the same ability. If the character's paladin level is 4th or higher, her effective turning level is her cleric level plus her paladin level minus 3. </p>
<p>In the special case of uncanny dodge, both experienced barbarians and experienced rogues have the same ability. When a barbarian/rogue would gain uncanny dodge a second time (for her second class), she instead gains improved uncanny dodge, if she does not already have it. Her barbarian and rogue levels stack to determine the rogue level an attacker needs to flank her. </p>
<p>In the special case of obtaining a familiar, both wizards and sorcerers have the same ability. A sorcerer/wizard stacks his sorcerer and wizard levels to determine the familiar's natural armor, Intelligence score, and special abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Feats:</strong> A multiclass character gains feats based on character levels, regardless of individual class level</p>
<p><strong>Ability Increases:</strong> A multiclass character gains ability score increases based on character level, regardless of individual class level.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> The character gains spells from all of his or her spellcasting classes and keeps a separate spell list for each class. If a spell's effect is based on the class level of the caster, the player must keep track of which class's spell list the character is casting the spell from.</p>

<p>The barbarian's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (4 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 4 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features"><a class="header" href="#class-features">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the barbarian.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Fast Movement (Ex):</strong> A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.</p>
<p><strong>Illiteracy:</strong> Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak.</p>
<p>A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.</p>
<p><strong>Rage (Ex):</strong> A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see below).</p>
<p>A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action, not in response to someone else's action.</p>
<p><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
<p><strong>Trap Sense (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Reduction (Ex):</strong> At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage Reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Rage (Ex):</strong> At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.</p>
<p><strong>Indomitable Will (Ex):</strong> While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.</p>
<p><strong>Tireless Rage (Ex):</strong> At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.</p>
<p><strong>Mighty Rage (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at -2.</p>
<h2 id="ex-barbarians"><a class="header" href="#ex-barbarians">Ex-Barbarians</a></h2>
<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. He retains all the other benefits of the class (damage reduction, fast movement, trap sense, and uncanny dodge).</p>

<p>The bard's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Speak Language (n/a), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
<p>Skill Points at 1st Level: (6 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p>Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 6 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-1"><a class="header" href="#class-features-1">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the bard.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard's Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Bard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. When Table: Bard Spells Known indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
<p>The bard's selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Bard Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Bard Spells Known are fixed.)</p>
<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard &quot;loses&quot; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
<p>As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level. </p>
<p><strong>Bardic Knowledge:</strong> A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)</p>
<p>A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random. </p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="center">DC</th><th align="left">Type of Knowledge</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="center">10</td><td align="left">Common, known by at least a substantial minority drinking; common legends of the local population.</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Bardic Music:</strong> Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.</p>
<p>Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that doesn't require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.</p>
<p><strong>Countersong (Su):</strong> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself ) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don't allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Fascinate (Sp):</strong> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.</p>
<p>To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.</p>
<p>Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Courage (Su):</strong> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself ), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Competence (Su):</strong> A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally.</p>
<p>The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard's music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can't inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion (Sp):</strong> A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not break the bard's concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the fascinate effect.</p>
<p>Making a suggestion doesn't count against a bard's daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard's level + bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see mass suggestion, below). Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Greatness (Su):</strong> A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Song of Freedom (Sp):</strong> A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the break enchantment spell (caster level equals the character's bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can't use song of freedom on himself.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Heroics (Su):</strong> A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Mass Suggestion (Sp):</strong> This ability functions like suggestion, above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the suggestion simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated (see above). Mass suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.</p>

<p>In addition to the stated number of spells per day for 1st- through 9th-level spells, a cleric gets a domain spell for each spell level, starting at 1st.</p>
<p>The &quot;+1&quot; in the entries on this table represents that spell. Domain spells are in addition to any bonus spells the cleric may receive for having a high Wisdom score.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> A cleric's alignment must be within one step of his deity's (that is, it may be one step away on either the lawful-chaotic axis or the good-evil axis, but not both). A cleric may not be neutral unless his deity's alignment is also neutral.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8.</p>
<h2 id="class-skills-2"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-2">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The cleric's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). </p>
<p><strong>Domains and Class Skills:</strong> A cleric who chooses the Animal or Plant domain adds Knowledge (nature) (Int) to the cleric class skills listed above. A cleric who chooses the Knowledge domain adds all Knowledge (Int) skills to the list. A cleric who chooses the Travel domain adds Survival (Wis) to the list. A cleric who chooses the Trickery domain adds Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), and Hide (Dex) to the list. See Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells, below, for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (2 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-2"><a class="header" href="#class-features-2">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the cleric.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p>A cleric who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat related to his deity's weapon as a bonus feat. He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.</p>
<p><strong>Aura (Ex):</strong> A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment (see the detect evil spell for details). Clerics who don't worship a specific deity but choose the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the cleric spell list. However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities, Domains, and Domain Spells, below).</p>
<p>Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells:</strong> A cleric's deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to his deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.</p>
<p>If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two domains to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p>
<p>Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. The cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.</p>
<p>With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Casting:</strong> A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can &quot;lose&quot; any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with &quot;cure&quot; in its name). </p>
<p>An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can't convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with &quot;inflict&quot; in its name).</p>
<p>A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player's choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or commands undead (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:</strong> A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su):</strong> Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead).</p>
<p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see above).</p>
<p>A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Languages:</strong> A cleric's bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.</p>
<h2 id="ex-clerics"><a class="header" href="#ex-clerics">Ex-Clerics</a></h2>
<p>A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and class features, except for armor and shield proficiencies and proficiency with simple weapons. He cannot thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that god until he atones (see the atonement spell description).</p>

<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8.</p>
<h2 id="class-skills-3"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-3">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The druid's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str). </p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (4 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 4 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-3"><a class="header" href="#class-features-3">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the druid.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the ironwood spell description) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.</p>
<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below).</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. She does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.</p>
<p>A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place (but see Spontaneous Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Casting:</strong> A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &quot;lose&quot; a prepared spell in order to cast any summon nature's ally spell of the same level or lower. Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Languages:</strong> A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Companion (Ex):</strong> A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.</p>
<p>A 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As a druid advances in level, the animal's power increases as shown on the table. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
<p>A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see below). Should she select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character's druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, she can't have that animal as a companion.) </p>
<p><strong>Nature Sense (Ex):</strong> A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Empathy (Ex):</strong> A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.</p>
<p>The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
<p><strong>Woodland Stride (Ex):</strong> Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.</p>
<p><strong>Trackless Step (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
<p><strong>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex):</strong> Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Shape (Su):</strong> At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with. </p>
<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
<p>A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table: The Druid. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.</p>
<p>The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level.</p>
<p>At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature with the same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can't use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn't a creature.)</p>
<p>At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental's feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type.</p>
<p>At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.</p>
<p><strong>Venom Immunity (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons. </p>
<p><strong>A Thousand Faces (Su):</strong> At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
<p><strong>Timeless Body (Ex):</strong> After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place.</p>
<p>Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
<h2 id="ex-druids"><a class="header" href="#ex-druids">Ex-Druids</a></h2>
<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the atonement spell description).</p>
<h1 id="the-druids-animal-companion"><a class="header" href="#the-druids-animal-companion">The Druid's Animal Companion</a></h1>
<p>A druid's animal companion is different from a normal animal of its kind in many ways. A druid's animal companion is superior to a normal animal of its kind and has special powers, as described below.</p>

<p><strong>Animal Companion Basics:</strong> Use the base statistics for a creature of the companion's kind, but make the following changes.</p>
<p><strong>Class Level:</strong> The character's druid level. The druid's class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an animal companion for the purpose of determining the companion's abilities and the alternative lists available to the character.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus HD:</strong> Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Remember that extra Hit Dice improve the animal companion's base attack and base save bonuses. An animal companion's base attack bonus is the same as that of a druid of a level equal to the animal's HD. An animal companion has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's HD). An animal companion gains additional skill points and feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice.</p>
<p>**Natural Armor Adj.: **The number noted here is an improvement to the animal companion's existing natural armor bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Str/Dex Adj.:</strong> Add this value to the animal companion's Strength and Dexterity scores.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Tricks:</strong> The value given in this column is the total number of &quot;bonus&quot; tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the druid might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill). These bonus tricks don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don't count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can't be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Link (Ex):</strong> A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion.</p>
<p><strong>Share Spells (Ex):</strong> At the druid's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts upon herself also affect her animal companion. The animal companion must be within 5 feet of her at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the animal companion if the companion moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the animal again, even if it returns to the druid before the duration expires. </p>
<p>Additionally, the druid may cast a spell with a target of &quot;You&quot; on her animal companion (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A druid and her animal companion can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type (animal).</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.</p>
<p><strong>Devotion (Ex):</strong> An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
<p><strong>Multiattack:</strong> An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second attack with its primary natural weapon, albeit at a -5 penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an animal companion takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.</p>

<p>The monk's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), and Tumble (Dex).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (4 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 4 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-5"><a class="header" href="#class-features-5">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the monk.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Monks are proficient with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and sling.</p>
<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields</p>
<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
<p><strong>AC Bonus (Ex):</strong> When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).</p>
<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
<p><strong>Flurry of Blows (Ex):</strong> When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack Bonus column on Table: The Monk. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.</p>
<p>When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus x ?1-1/2 or x?1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The monk can't use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.</p>
<p>In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so. </p>
<p>When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Unarmed Strike:</strong> At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
<p>Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
<p>A monk's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
<p>A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table: The Monk. The unarmed damage on Table: The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feat:</strong> At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Movement (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed, as shown on Table: The Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
<p><strong>Still Mind (Ex):</strong> A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.</p>
<p><strong>Ki Strike (Su):</strong> At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. Ki strike improves with the character's monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Fall (Ex):</strong> At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk's ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her descent and fall any distance without harm.</p>
<p><strong>Purity of Body (Ex):</strong> At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Wholeness of Body (Su):</strong> At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Diamond Body (Su):</strong> At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.</p>
<p><strong>Abundant Step (Su):</strong> At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door, once per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded down).</p>
<p><strong>Diamond Soul (Ex):</strong> At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Quivering Palm (Su):</strong> Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.</p>
<p><strong>Timeless Body (Ex):</strong> Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
<p><strong>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex):</strong> A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.</p>
<p><strong>Empty Body (Su):</strong> At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using the spell etherealness. She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Self:</strong> At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.</p>
<h2 id="ex-monks"><a class="header" href="#ex-monks">Ex-Monks</a></h2>
<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>
<p>Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a multiclass character, but multiclass monks face a special restriction. A monk who gains a new class or (if already multiclass) raises another class by a level may never again raise her monk level, though she retains all her monk abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Lawful good.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d10.</p>
<h2 id="class-skills-6"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-6">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The paladin's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nobility and royalty) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), and Sense Motive (Wis).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (2 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-6"><a class="header" href="#class-features-6">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the paladin.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Good (Ex):</strong> The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to her paladin level.</p>
<p><strong>Detect Evil (Sp):</strong> At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Smite Evil (Su):</strong> Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.</p>
<p>At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.</p>
<p>Divine Grace (Su): At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
<p><strong>Lay on Hands (Su):</strong> Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn't have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Courage (Su):</strong> Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.</p>
<p>This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Health (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Turn Undead (Su):</strong> When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of three levels lower would.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Paladin. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Paladin indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level The paladin does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.</p>
<p>A paladin prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to spontaneously cast a cure spell in its place. A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
<p>Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is one-half her paladin level.</p>
<p><strong>Special Mount (Sp):</strong> Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin gains the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil (see below). This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin).</p>
<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the celestial realms in which it resides. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the paladin may release a particular mount from service.</p>
<p>Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect.</p>
<p>Should the paladin's mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The paladin may not summon another mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first, even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the paladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Remove Disease (Sp):</strong> At 6th level, a paladin can produce a remove disease effect, as the spell, once per week. She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth).</p>
<p><strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act.</p>
<p>Additionally, a paladin's code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.</p>
<p><strong>Associates:</strong> While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.</p>
<h2 id="ex-paladins"><a class="header" href="#ex-paladins">Ex-Paladins</a></h2>
<p>A paladin who ceases to be lawful good, who willfully commits an evil act, or who grossly violates the code of conduct loses all paladin spells and abilities (including the service of the paladin's mount, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She may not progress any farther in levels as a paladin. She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations (see the atonement spell description), as appropriate.</p>
<p>Like a member of any other class, a paladin may be a multiclass character, but multiclass paladins face a special restriction. A paladin who gains a level in any class other than paladin may never again raise her paladin level, though she retains all her paladin abilities.</p>
<h2 id="the-paladins-mount"><a class="header" href="#the-paladins-mount">The Paladin's Mount</a></h2>
<p>The paladin's mount is superior to a normal mount of its kind and has special powers, as described below. The standard mount for a Medium paladin is a heavy warhorse, and the standard mount for a Small paladin is a warpony. Another kind of mount, such as a riding dog (for a halfling paladin) or a Large shark (for a paladin in an aquatic campaign) may be allowed as well.</p>
<p>A paladin's mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects that depend on its type (though it retains an animal's HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).</p>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Paladin's Mount Basics:</strong> Use the base statistics for a creature of the mount's kind, but make changes to take into account the attributes and characteristics summarized on the table and described below.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus HD:</strong> Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve the mount's base attack and base save bonuses. A special mount's base attack bonus is equal to that of a cleric of a level equal to the mount's HD. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's HD). The mount gains additional skill points or feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Armor Adj.:</strong> The number on the table is an improvement to the mount's existing natural armor bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Str Adj.:</strong> Add this figure to the mount's Strength score.</p>
<p><strong>Int:</strong> The mount's Intelligence score.</p>
<p><strong>Empathic Link (Su):</strong> The paladin has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The paladin cannot see through the mount's eyes, but they can communicate empathically.</p>
<p>Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible.</p>
<p>Because of this empathic link, the paladin has the same connection to an item or place that her mount does, just as with a master and his familiar (see Familiars).</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.</p>
<p><strong>Share Spells:</strong> At the paladin's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount. </p>
<p>The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before the duration expires. Additionally, the paladin may cast a spell with a target of &quot;You&quot; on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A paladin and her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount's type (magical beast).</p>
<p><strong>Share Saving Throws:</strong> For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the paladin's, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any other bonuses on saves that the master might have.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Speed (Ex):</strong> The mount's speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Command (Sp):</strong> Once per day per two paladin levels of its master, a mount can use this ability to command other any normal animal of approximately the same kind as itself (for warhorses and warponies, this category includes donkeys, mules, and ponies), as long as the target creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount. This ability functions like the command spell, but the mount must make a DC 21 Concentration check to succeed if it's being ridden at the time. If the check fails, the ability does not work that time, but it still counts against the mount's daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin's level + paladin's Cha modifier) to negate the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Resistance (Ex):</strong> A mount's spell resistance equals its master's paladin level + 5. To affect the mount with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the mount's spell resistance.</p>

<h2 id="class-skills-7"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-7">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The ranger's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Search (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Rope (Dex).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (6 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 6 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-7"><a class="header" href="#class-features-7">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the ranger.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Favored Enemy (Ex):</strong> At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table: Ranger Favored Enemies. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.</p>
<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. </p>
<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>
<p><strong>Track:</strong> A ranger gains Track as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Empathy (Ex):</strong> A ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Style (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character's class features but does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any way.</p>
<p>If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Companion (Ex):</strong> At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures may be added to the ranger's list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind.</p>
<p>This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except that the ranger's effective druid level is one-half his ranger level. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The ranger does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.</p>
<p>A ranger prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though he cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his ranger level.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Combat Style (Ex):</strong> At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>Woodland Stride (Ex):</strong> Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
<p>However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him.</p>
<p><strong>Swift Tracker (Ex):</strong> Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Style Mastery (Ex):</strong> At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Precise Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>Camouflage (Ex):</strong> A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
<p><strong>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):</strong> While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Hide skill even while being observed.</p>

<p>The rogue's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Forgery (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (local) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), Use Magic Device (Cha), and Use Rope (Dex).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (8 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 8 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-8"><a class="header" href="#class-features-8">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the rogue.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
<p><strong>Sneak Attack:</strong> If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
<p>The rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.</p>
<p>Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
<p>With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.</p>
<p>A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies--undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.</p>
<p><strong>Trapfinding:</strong> Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. </p>
<p>Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.</p>
<p>Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.</p>
<p>A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Trap Sense (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.</p>
<p>Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
<p><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.</p>
<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked.</p>
<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.</p>
<p><strong>Crippling Strike (Ex):</strong> A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.</p>
<p><strong>Defensive Roll (Ex):</strong> The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll--if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunist (Ex):</strong> Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue's attack of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can't use the opportunist ability more than once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Mastery:</strong> The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time.</p>
<p><strong>Slippery Mind (Ex):</strong> This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.</p>

<h2 id="class-skills-9"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-9">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The sorcerer's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (2 + Int modifier) x 4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-9"><a class="header" href="#class-features-9">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer's gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see below).</p>
<p>To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer's Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.</p>
<p>A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. The sorcerer can't use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.</p>
<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer &quot;loses&quot; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can cast. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
<p>Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he'll cast.</p>
<p><strong>Familiar:</strong> A sorcerer can obtain a familiar (see below). Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.</p>
<p>The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.</p>
<p>If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer's experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.</p>
<p>A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.</p>

<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d4.</p>
<h2 id="class-skills-10"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-10">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The wizard's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4: Skills for skill descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (2 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-10"><a class="header" href="#class-features-10">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the wizard.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard's movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A wizard casts arcane spells which are drawn from the sorcerer/ wizard spell list. A wizard must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time (see below).</p>
<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard's Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Wizard. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.</p>
<p>Unlike a bard or sorcerer, a wizard may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting a good night's sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Languages:</strong> A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
<p><strong>Familiar:</strong> A wizard can obtain a familiar in exactly the same manner as a sorcerer can. See the sorcerer description and the information on Familiars below for details.</p>
<p><strong>Scribe Scroll:</strong> At 1st level, a wizard gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. </p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.</p>
<p>These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing these feats.</p>
<p><strong>Spellbooks:</strong> A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic, which all wizards can prepare from memory.</p>
<p>A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited school or schools, if any; see School Specialization, below) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards' spellbooks to her own.</p>
<h2 id="school-specialization"><a class="header" href="#school-specialization">School Specialization</a></h2>
<p>A school is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common theme. If desired, a wizard may specialize in one school of magic (see below). Specialization allows a wizard to cast extra spells from her chosen school, but she then never learns to cast spells from some other schools.</p>
<p>A specialist wizard can prepare one additional spell of her specialty school per spell level each day. She also gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.</p>
<p>The wizard must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose her specialty at 1st level. At this time, she must also give up two other schools of magic (unless she chooses to specialize in divination; see below), which become her prohibited schools.</p>
<p>A wizard can never give up divination to fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>Spells of the prohibited school or schools are not available to the wizard, and she can't even cast such spells from scrolls or fire them from wands. She may not change either her specialization or her prohibited schools later.</p>
<p>The eight schools of arcane magic are abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation.</p>
<p>Spells that do not fall into any of these schools are called universal spells.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abjuration:</strong> Spells that protect, block, or banish. An abjuration specialist is called an abjurer.</li>
<li><strong>Conjuration:</strong> Spells that bring creatures or materials to the caster. A conjuration specialist is called a conjurer.</li>
<li><strong>Divination:</strong> Spells that reveal information. A divination specialist is called a diviner. Unlike the other specialists, a diviner must give up only one other school.</li>
<li><strong>Enchantment:</strong> Spells that imbue the recipient with some property or grant the caster power over another being. An enchantment specialist is called an enchanter.</li>
<li><strong>Evocation:</strong> Spells that manipulate energy or create something from nothing. An evocation specialist is called an evoker.</li>
<li><strong>Illusion:</strong> Spells that alter perception or create false images. An illusion specialist is called an illusionist.</li>
<li><strong>Necromancy:</strong> Spells that manipulate, create, or destroy life or life force. A necromancy specialist is called a necromancer.</li>
<li><strong>Transmutation:</strong> Spells that transform the recipient physically or change its properties in a more subtle way. A transmutation specialist is called a transmuter.</li>
<li><strong>Universal:</strong> Not a school, but a category for spells that all wizards can learn. A wizard cannot select universal as a specialty school or as a prohibited school. Only a limited number of spells fall into this category.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="familiars"><a class="header" href="#familiars">Familiars</a></h2>
<p>A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.</p>
<p>A familiar also grants special abilities to its master (a sorcerer or wizard), as given on the table below. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.</p>
<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master's level.</p>

<h3 id="familiar-basics"><a class="header" href="#familiar-basics">Familiar Basics</a></h3>
<p>Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar's kind, but make the following changes:</p>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal HD total, whichever is higher.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> The familiar has one-half the master's total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.</p>
<p><strong>Attacks:</strong> Use the master's base attack bonus, as calculated from all his classes. Use the familiar's Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the familiar's melee attack bonus with natural weapons.</p>
<p>Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind.</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> For each saving throw, use either the familiar's base save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the master's (as calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or the master's skill ranks, whichever are better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar's total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar's ability to use.</p>
<h3 id="familiar-ability-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#familiar-ability-descriptions">Familiar Ability Descriptions</a></h3>
<p>All familiars have special abilities (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the master's combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table below. The abilities given on the table are cumulative.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Natural Armor Adj.:</strong> The number noted here is an improvement to the familiar's existing natural armor bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Int:</strong> The familiar's Intelligence score.</p>
<p><strong>Alertness (Ex):</strong> While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master gains the Alertness feat.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.</p>
<p><strong>Share Spells:</strong> At the master's option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his familiar. The familiar must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit.</p>
<p>If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the familiar if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the familiar again even if it returns to the master before the duration expires. Additionally, the master may cast a spell with a target of &quot;You&quot; on his familiar (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself.</p>
<p>A master and his familiar can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the familiar's type (magical beast).</p>
<p><strong>Empathic Link (Su):</strong> The master has an empathic link with his familiar out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The master cannot see through the familiar's eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.</p>
<p>Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.</p>
<p><strong>Deliver Touch Spells (Su):</strong> If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the &quot;toucher.&quot; The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.</p>
<p><strong>Speak with Master (Ex):</strong> If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.</p>
<p><strong>Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex):</strong> If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with amphibians, weasels with similar creatures (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks, wolverines, and badgers). Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Resistance (Ex):</strong> If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar's spell resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Scry on Familiar (Sp):</strong> If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the scrying spell) once per day.</p>
