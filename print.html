<p>This is the System Reference Document v3.5,
converted from the original RTF files into Markdown.
The bulk of the conversion work was done programmatically.
After that, fixes were applied by hand.</p>
<p>While the content is organized into more pages than the base RTF files,
there are not any <em>intentional</em> rules differences between this markdown version and the official RTF version.
However, typos and errors are always possible.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-basics"><a class="header" href="#the-basics">The Basics</a></h1>
<p><strong>The Core Mechanic:</strong> Whenever you attempt an action that has some chance of failure, you roll a twenty-sided die (d20). To determine if your character succeeds at a task you do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll a d20.</li>
<li>Add any relevant modifiers.</li>
<li>Compare the result to a target number.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the result equals or exceeds the target number, your character succeeds. If the result is lower than the target number, you fail.</p>
<h2 id="dice"><a class="header" href="#dice">Dice</a></h2>
<p>Dice rolls are described with expressions such as &quot;3d4+3,&quot; which means &quot;roll three four-sided dice and add 3&quot; (resulting in a number between 6 and 15). The first number tells you how many dice to roll (adding the results together). The number immediately after the &quot;d&quot; tells you the type of die to use. Any number after that indicates a quantity that is added or subtracted from the result.</p>
<p><strong>d%:</strong> Percentile dice work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before you roll) is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100.</p>
<h2 id="rounding-fractions"><a class="header" href="#rounding-fractions">Rounding Fractions</a></h2>
<p>In general, if you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the fraction is one-half or larger.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Certain rolls, such as damage and hit points, have a minimum of 1.</p>
<h2 id="multiplying"><a class="header" href="#multiplying">Multiplying</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes a rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll. As long as you're applying a single multiplier, multiply the number normally. When two or more multipliers apply to any abstract value (such as a modifier or a die roll), however, combine them into a single multiple, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. Thus, a double (x2) and a double (x2) applied to the same number results in a triple (x3, because 2 + 1 = 3).</p>
<p>When applying multipliers to real-world values (such as weight or distance), normal rules of math apply instead. A creature whose size doubles (thus multiplying its weight by 8) and then is turned to stone (which would multiply its weight by a factor of roughly 3) now weighs about 24 times normal, not 10 times normal. Similarly, a blinded creature attempting to negotiate difficult terrain would count each square as 4 squares (doubling the cost twice, for a total multiplier of x4), rather than as 3 squares (adding 100% twice). </p>
<h2 id="ability-scores"><a class="header" href="#ability-scores">Ability Scores</a></h2>
<h3 id="ability-modifiers"><a class="header" href="#ability-modifiers">Ability Modifiers</a></h3>
<p>Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging from -5 to +5. Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells shows the modifier for each score. It also shows bonus spells, which you'll need to know about if your character is a spellcaster.</p>
<p>The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren't die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty.</p>
<h4 id="table-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells"><a class="header" href="#table-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a></h4>
<p>Bonus Spell slots are listed by spell level.</p>
<p>A character never gains bonus 0th level slots.</p>
<p>If a character's ability score is 9 or less they cannot cast spells associated with that ability.</p>

<h3 id="abilities-and-spellcasters"><a class="header" href="#abilities-and-spellcasters">Abilities And Spellcasters</a></h3>
<p>The ability that governs bonus spells depends on what type of spellcaster your character is: Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers; or Charisma for sorcerers and bards. In addition to having a high ability score, a spellcaster must be of high enough class level to be able to cast spells of a given spell level. (See the class descriptions for details.)</p>
<h3 id="the-abilities"><a class="header" href="#the-abilities">The Abilities</a></h3>
<p>Each ability partially describes your character and affects some of his or her actions.</p>
<h4 id="strength-str"><a class="header" href="#strength-str">Strength (Str)</a></h4>
<p>Strength measures your character's muscle and physical power. This ability is especially important for fighters, barbarians, paladins, rangers, and monks because it helps them prevail in combat. Strength also limits the amount of equipment your character can carry.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Strength modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Melee attack rolls.</li>
<li>Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon (including a sling). (Exceptions: Off-hand attacks receive only one-half the character's Strength bonus, while two-handed attacks receive one and a half times the Strength bonus. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies to attacks made with a bow that is not a composite bow.)</li>
<li>Climb, Jump, and Swim checks. These are the skills that have Strength as their key ability.</li>
<li>Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dexterity-dex"><a class="header" href="#dexterity-dex">Dexterity (Dex)</a></h4>
<p>Dexterity measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is the most important one for rogues, but it's also high on the list for characters who typically wear light or medium armor (rangers and barbarians) or no armor at all (monks, wizards, and sorcerers), and for anyone who wants to be a skilled archer.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ranged attack rolls, including those for attacks made with bows, crossbows, throwing axes, and other ranged weapons.</li>
<li>Armor Class (AC), provided that the character can react to the attack.</li>
<li>Reflex saving throws, for avoiding fireballs and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly.</li>
<li>Balance, Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, Ride, Sleight of Hand, Tumble, and Use Rope checks. These are the skills that have Dexterity as their key ability.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="constitution-con"><a class="header" href="#constitution-con">Constitution (Con)</a></h4>
<p>Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, so the ability is important for all classes.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Constitution modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each roll of a Hit Die (though a penalty can never drop a result below 1--that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit point each time he or she advances in level).</li>
<li>Fortitude saving throws, for resisting poison and similar threats.</li>
<li>Concentration checks. Concentration is a skill, important to spellcasters, that has Constitution as its key ability.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a character's Constitution score changes enough to alter his or her Constitution modifier, the character's hit points also increase or decrease accordingly.</p>
<h4 id="intelligence-int"><a class="header" href="#intelligence-int">Intelligence (Int)</a></h4>
<p>Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This ability is important for wizards because it affects how many spells they can cast, how hard their spells are to resist, and how powerful their spells can be. It's also important for any character who wants to have a wide assortment of skills.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of languages your character knows at the start of the game.</li>
<li>The number of skill points gained each level. (But your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.)</li>
<li>Appraise, Craft, Decipher Script, Disable Device, Forgery, Knowledge, Search, and Spellcraft checks. These are the skills that have Intelligence as their key ability.</li>
</ul>
<p>A wizard gains bonus spells based on her Intelligence score. The minimum Intelligence score needed to cast a wizard spell is 10 + the spell's level. </p>
<p>An animal has an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. A creature of humanlike intelligence has a score of at least 3.</p>
<h4 id="wisdom-wis"><a class="header" href="#wisdom-wis">Wisdom (Wis)</a></h4>
<p>Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While Intelligence represents one's ability to analyze information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one's surroundings. Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and druids, and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will saving throws (for negating the effect of charm person and other spells).</li>
<li>Heal, Listen, Profession, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks. These are the skills that have Wisdom as their key ability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers get bonus spells based on their Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a cleric, druid, paladin, or ranger spell is 10 + the spell's level.</p>
<h4 id="charisma-cha"><a class="header" href="#charisma-cha">Charisma (Cha)</a></h4>
<p>Charisma measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social setting. Charisma is most important for paladins, sorcerers, and bards. It is also important for clerics, since it affects their ability to turn undead. Every creature has a Charisma score.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Gather Information, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Perform, and Use Magic Device checks. These are the skills that have Charisma as their key ability.</li>
<li>Checks that represent attempts to influence others. </li>
<li>Turning checks for clerics and paladins attempting to turn zombies, vampires, and other undead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorcerers and bards get bonus spells based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma score needed to cast a sorcerer or bard spell is 10 + the spell's level.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-changes"><a class="header" href="#ability-score-changes">Ability Score Changes</a></h3>
<p>When an ability score changes, all attributes associated with that score change accordingly. A character does not retroactively get additional skill points for previous levels if she increases her intelligence.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="races"><a class="header" href="#races">Races</a></h1>
<h2 id="favored-class"><a class="header" href="#favored-class">Favored Class</a></h2>
<p>A character's favored class doesn't count against him or her when determining experience point penalties for multiclassing. </p>
<h2 id="race-and-languages"><a class="header" href="#race-and-languages">Race and Languages</a></h2>
<p>All characters know how to speak Common. A dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, or halfling also speaks a racial language, as appropriate. A character who has an Intelligence bonus at 1st level speaks other languages as well, one extra language per point of Intelligence bonus as a starting character. </p>
<p><strong>Literacy:</strong> Any character except a barbarian can read and write all the languages he or she speaks.</p>
<p><strong>Class-Related Languages:</strong> Clerics, druids, and wizards can choose certain languages as bonus languages even if they're not on the lists found in the race descriptions. These class-related languages are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleric: Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal.</li>
<li>Druid: Sylvan.</li>
<li>Wizard: Draconic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="small-characters"><a class="header" href="#small-characters">Small Characters</a></h2>
<p>A Small character gets a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. A Small character's carrying capacity is three-quarters of that of a Medium character.</p>
<p>A Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as a Medium character.</p>
<p>A Small character must use smaller weapons than a Medium character.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dwarf"><a class="header" href="#dwarf">Dwarf</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>+2 Constitution, -2 Charisma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medium:</strong> As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such situations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Darkvision:</strong> Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves can function just fine with no light at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stonecunning:</strong> This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weapon Familiarity:</strong> Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic Languages:</strong> Common and Elven. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, and Sylvan.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>+4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type. Any time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when it's caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too.</p>

<h2 id="arcane-spells-and-armor"><a class="header" href="#arcane-spells-and-armor">Arcane Spells And Armor</a></h2>
<p>Wizards and sorcerers do not know how to wear armor effectively.</p>
<p>If desired, they can wear armor anyway (though they'll be clumsy in it), or they can gain training in the proper use of armor (with the various Armor Proficiency feats--light, medium, and heavy--and the Shield Proficiency feat), or they can multiclass to add a class that grants them armor proficiency. Even if a wizard or sorcerer is wearing armor with which he or she is proficient, however, it might still interfere with spellcasting.</p>
<p>Armor restricts the complicated gestures that a wizards or sorcerer must make while casting any spell that has a somatic component (most do). The armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.</p>
<p>By contrast, bards not only know how to wear light armor effectively, but they can also ignore the arcane spell failure chance for such armor. A bard wearing armor heavier than light or using any type of shield incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance, even if he becomes proficient with that armor.</p>
<p>If a spell doesn't have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no problem while wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster's hands are bound or if he or she is grappling (although Concentration checks still apply normally). Also, the metamagic feat Still Spell allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell at one spell level higher than normal without the somatic component. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.</p>
<h2 id="multiclass-characters"><a class="header" href="#multiclass-characters">Multiclass Characters</a></h2>
<p>A character may add new classes as he or she progresses in level, thus becoming a multiclass character. The class abilities from a character's different classes combine to determine a multiclass character's overall abilities. Multiclassing improves a character's versatility at the expense of focus.</p>
<h3 id="class-and-level-features"><a class="header" href="#class-and-level-features">Class And Level Features</a></h3>
<p>As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum of the abilities of each of the character's classes.</p>
<p><strong>Level:</strong> &quot;Character level&quot; is a character's total number of levels. It is used to determine when feats and ability score boosts are gained.</p>
<p>&quot;Class level&quot; is a character's level in a particular class. For a character whose levels are all in the same class, character level and class level are the same.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> A character gains hit points from each class as his or her class level increases, adding the new hit points to the previous total. </p>
<p><strong>Base Attack Bonus:</strong> Add the base attack bonuses acquired for each class to get the character's base attack bonus. A resulting value of +6 or higher provides the character with multiple attacks. </p>
<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Add the base save bonuses for each class together.</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> If a skill is a class skill for any of a multiclass character's classes, then character level determines a skill's maximum rank. (The maximum rank for a class skill is 3 + character level.)</p>
<p>If a skill is not a class skill for any of a multiclass character's classes, the maximum rank for that skill is one-half the maximum for a class skill.</p>
<p><strong>Class Features:</strong> A multiclass character gets all the class features of all his or her classes but must also suffer the consequences of the special restrictions of all his or her classes. (Exception: A character who acquires the barbarian class does not become illiterate.) </p>
<p>In the special case of turning undead, both clerics and experienced paladins have the same ability. If the character's paladin level is 4th or higher, her effective turning level is her cleric level plus her paladin level minus 3. </p>
<p>In the special case of uncanny dodge, both experienced barbarians and experienced rogues have the same ability. When a barbarian/rogue would gain uncanny dodge a second time (for her second class), she instead gains improved uncanny dodge, if she does not already have it. Her barbarian and rogue levels stack to determine the rogue level an attacker needs to flank her. </p>
<p>In the special case of obtaining a familiar, both wizards and sorcerers have the same ability. A sorcerer/wizard stacks his sorcerer and wizard levels to determine the familiar's natural armor, Intelligence score, and special abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Feats:</strong> A multiclass character gains feats based on character levels, regardless of individual class level</p>
<p><strong>Ability Increases:</strong> A multiclass character gains ability score increases based on character level, regardless of individual class level.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> The character gains spells from all of his or her spellcasting classes and keeps a separate spell list for each class. If a spell's effect is based on the class level of the caster, the player must keep track of which class's spell list the character is casting the spell from.</p>

<h2 id="class-skills"><a class="header" href="#class-skills">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The barbarian's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (4 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 4 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features"><a class="header" href="#class-features">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the barbarian.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Fast Movement (Ex):</strong> A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.</p>
<p><strong>Illiteracy:</strong> Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak.</p>
<p>A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.</p>
<p><strong>Rage (Ex):</strong> A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see below).</p>
<p>A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action, not in response to someone else's action.</p>
<p><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
<p><strong>Trap Sense (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Reduction (Ex):</strong> At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage Reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Rage (Ex):</strong> At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.</p>
<p><strong>Indomitable Will (Ex):</strong> While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.</p>
<p><strong>Tireless Rage (Ex):</strong> At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.</p>
<p><strong>Mighty Rage (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at -2.</p>
<h2 id="ex-barbarians"><a class="header" href="#ex-barbarians">Ex-Barbarians</a></h2>
<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. He retains all the other benefits of the class (damage reduction, fast movement, trap sense, and uncanny dodge).</p>

<p>Skill Points at 1st Level: (6 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p>Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 6 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-1"><a class="header" href="#class-features-1">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the bard.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard's Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Bard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. When Table: Bard Spells Known indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
<p>The bard's selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Bard Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Bard Spells Known are fixed.)</p>
<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard &quot;loses&quot; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
<p>As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level. </p>
<p><strong>Bardic Knowledge:</strong> A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)</p>
<p>A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random. </p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="center">DC</th><th align="left">Type of Knowledge</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="center">10</td><td align="left">Common, known by at least a substantial minority drinking; common legends of the local population.</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Bardic Music:</strong> Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.</p>
<p>Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that doesn't require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.</p>
<p><strong>Countersong (Su):</strong> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself ) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don't allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Fascinate (Sp):</strong> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.</p>
<p>To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.</p>
<p>Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Courage (Su):</strong> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself ), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Competence (Su):</strong> A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally.</p>
<p>The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard's music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can't inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion (Sp):</strong> A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not break the bard's concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the fascinate effect.</p>
<p>Making a suggestion doesn't count against a bard's daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard's level + bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see mass suggestion, below). Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Greatness (Su):</strong> A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Song of Freedom (Sp):</strong> A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the break enchantment spell (caster level equals the character's bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can't use song of freedom on himself.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Heroics (Su):</strong> A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Mass Suggestion (Sp):</strong> This ability functions like suggestion, above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the suggestion simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated (see above). Mass suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>In addition to the stated number of spells per day for 1st- through 9th-level spells, a cleric gets a domain spell for each spell level, starting at 1st.</p>
<p>The &quot;+1&quot; in the entries on this table represents that spell. Domain spells are in addition to any bonus spells the cleric may receive for having a high Wisdom score.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> A cleric's alignment must be within one step of his deity's (that is, it may be one step away on either the lawful-chaotic axis or the good-evil axis, but not both). A cleric may not be neutral unless his deity's alignment is also neutral.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8.</p>
<h2 id="class-skills-2"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-2">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The cleric's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). </p>
<p><strong>Domains and Class Skills:</strong> A cleric who chooses the Animal or Plant domain adds Knowledge (nature) (Int) to the cleric class skills listed above. A cleric who chooses the Knowledge domain adds all Knowledge (Int) skills to the list. A cleric who chooses the Travel domain adds Survival (Wis) to the list. A cleric who chooses the Trickery domain adds Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), and Hide (Dex) to the list. See Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells, below, for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (2 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-2"><a class="header" href="#class-features-2">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the cleric.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p>A cleric who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat related to his deity's weapon as a bonus feat. He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.</p>
<p><strong>Aura (Ex):</strong> A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment (see the detect evil spell for details). Clerics who don't worship a specific deity but choose the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the cleric spell list. However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities, Domains, and Domain Spells, below).</p>
<p>Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells:</strong> A cleric's deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to his deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.</p>
<p>If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two domains to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p>
<p>Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. The cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.</p>
<p>With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Casting:</strong> A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can &quot;lose&quot; any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with &quot;cure&quot; in its name). </p>
<p>An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can't convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with &quot;inflict&quot; in its name).</p>
<p>A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player's choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or commands undead (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:</strong> A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su):</strong> Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead).</p>
<p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see above).</p>
<p>A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Languages:</strong> A cleric's bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.</p>
<h2 id="ex-clerics"><a class="header" href="#ex-clerics">Ex-Clerics</a></h2>
<p>A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and class features, except for armor and shield proficiencies and proficiency with simple weapons. He cannot thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that god until he atones (see the atonement spell description).</p>

<h2 id="class-skills-3"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-3">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The druid's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str). </p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (4 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 4 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-3"><a class="header" href="#class-features-3">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the druid.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the ironwood spell description) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.</p>
<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below).</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. She does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.</p>
<p>A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place (but see Spontaneous Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Casting:</strong> A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &quot;lose&quot; a prepared spell in order to cast any summon nature's ally spell of the same level or lower. Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Languages:</strong> A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Companion (Ex):</strong> A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.</p>
<p>A 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As a druid advances in level, the animal's power increases as shown on the table. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
<p>A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see below). Should she select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character's druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, she can't have that animal as a companion.) </p>
<p><strong>Nature Sense (Ex):</strong> A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Empathy (Ex):</strong> A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.</p>
<p>The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
<p><strong>Woodland Stride (Ex):</strong> Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.</p>
<p><strong>Trackless Step (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
<p><strong>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex):</strong> Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Shape (Su):</strong> At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with. </p>
<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
<p>A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table: The Druid. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.</p>
<p>The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level.</p>
<p>At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature with the same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can't use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn't a creature.)</p>
<p>At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental's feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type.</p>
<p>At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.</p>
<p><strong>Venom Immunity (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons. </p>
<p><strong>A Thousand Faces (Su):</strong> At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
<p><strong>Timeless Body (Ex):</strong> After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place.</p>
<p>Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
<h2 id="ex-druids"><a class="header" href="#ex-druids">Ex-Druids</a></h2>
<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the atonement spell description).</p>
<h1 id="the-druids-animal-companion"><a class="header" href="#the-druids-animal-companion">The Druid's Animal Companion</a></h1>
<p>A druid's animal companion is different from a normal animal of its kind in many ways. A druid's animal companion is superior to a normal animal of its kind and has special powers, as described below.</p>

<p><strong>Animal Companion Basics:</strong> Use the base statistics for a creature of the companion's kind, but make the following changes.</p>
<p><strong>Class Level:</strong> The character's druid level. The druid's class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an animal companion for the purpose of determining the companion's abilities and the alternative lists available to the character.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus HD:</strong> Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Remember that extra Hit Dice improve the animal companion's base attack and base save bonuses. An animal companion's base attack bonus is the same as that of a druid of a level equal to the animal's HD. An animal companion has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's HD). An animal companion gains additional skill points and feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice.</p>
<p>**Natural Armor Adj.: **The number noted here is an improvement to the animal companion's existing natural armor bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Str/Dex Adj.:</strong> Add this value to the animal companion's Strength and Dexterity scores.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Tricks:</strong> The value given in this column is the total number of &quot;bonus&quot; tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the druid might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill). These bonus tricks don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don't count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can't be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Link (Ex):</strong> A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion.</p>
<p><strong>Share Spells (Ex):</strong> At the druid's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts upon herself also affect her animal companion. The animal companion must be within 5 feet of her at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the animal companion if the companion moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the animal again, even if it returns to the druid before the duration expires. </p>
<p>Additionally, the druid may cast a spell with a target of &quot;You&quot; on her animal companion (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A druid and her animal companion can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type (animal).</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.</p>
<p><strong>Devotion (Ex):</strong> An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
<p><strong>Multiattack:</strong> An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second attack with its primary natural weapon, albeit at a -5 penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an animal companion takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.</p>

<h2 id="class-skills-5"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-5">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The monk's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), and Tumble (Dex).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (4 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 4 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-5"><a class="header" href="#class-features-5">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the monk.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Monks are proficient with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and sling.</p>
<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields</p>
<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
<p><strong>AC Bonus (Ex):</strong> When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).</p>
<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
<p><strong>Flurry of Blows (Ex):</strong> When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack Bonus column on Table: The Monk. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.</p>
<p>When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus x ?1-1/2 or x?1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The monk can't use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.</p>
<p>In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so. </p>
<p>When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Unarmed Strike:</strong> At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
<p>Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
<p>A monk's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
<p>A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table: The Monk. The unarmed damage on Table: The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feat:</strong> At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Movement (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed, as shown on Table: The Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
<p><strong>Still Mind (Ex):</strong> A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.</p>
<p><strong>Ki Strike (Su):</strong> At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. Ki strike improves with the character's monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Fall (Ex):</strong> At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk's ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her descent and fall any distance without harm.</p>
<p><strong>Purity of Body (Ex):</strong> At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Wholeness of Body (Su):</strong> At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Diamond Body (Su):</strong> At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.</p>
<p><strong>Abundant Step (Su):</strong> At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door, once per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded down).</p>
<p><strong>Diamond Soul (Ex):</strong> At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Quivering Palm (Su):</strong> Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.</p>
<p><strong>Timeless Body (Ex):</strong> Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
<p><strong>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex):</strong> A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.</p>
<p><strong>Empty Body (Su):</strong> At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using the spell etherealness. She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Self:</strong> At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.</p>
<h2 id="ex-monks"><a class="header" href="#ex-monks">Ex-Monks</a></h2>
<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>
<p>Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a multiclass character, but multiclass monks face a special restriction. A monk who gains a new class or (if already multiclass) raises another class by a level may never again raise her monk level, though she retains all her monk abilities.</p>

<h2 id="class-skills-6"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-6">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The paladin's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nobility and royalty) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), and Sense Motive (Wis).</p>

<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-6"><a class="header" href="#class-features-6">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the paladin.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Good (Ex):</strong> The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to her paladin level.</p>
<p><strong>Detect Evil (Sp):</strong> At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Smite Evil (Su):</strong> Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.</p>
<p>At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.</p>
<p>Divine Grace (Su): At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
<p><strong>Lay on Hands (Su):</strong> Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn't have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Courage (Su):</strong> Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.</p>
<p>This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Health (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Turn Undead (Su):</strong> When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of three levels lower would.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Paladin. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Paladin indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level The paladin does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.</p>
<p>A paladin prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to spontaneously cast a cure spell in its place. A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
<p>Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is one-half her paladin level.</p>
<p><strong>Special Mount (Sp):</strong> Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin gains the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil (see below). This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin).</p>
<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the celestial realms in which it resides. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the paladin may release a particular mount from service.</p>
<p>Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect.</p>
<p>Should the paladin's mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The paladin may not summon another mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first, even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the paladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Remove Disease (Sp):</strong> At 6th level, a paladin can produce a remove disease effect, as the spell, once per week. She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth).</p>
<p><strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act.</p>
<p>Additionally, a paladin's code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.</p>
<p><strong>Associates:</strong> While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.</p>
<h2 id="ex-paladins"><a class="header" href="#ex-paladins">Ex-Paladins</a></h2>
<p>A paladin who ceases to be lawful good, who willfully commits an evil act, or who grossly violates the code of conduct loses all paladin spells and abilities (including the service of the paladin's mount, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She may not progress any farther in levels as a paladin. She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations (see the atonement spell description), as appropriate.</p>
<p>Like a member of any other class, a paladin may be a multiclass character, but multiclass paladins face a special restriction. A paladin who gains a level in any class other than paladin may never again raise her paladin level, though she retains all her paladin abilities.</p>
<h2 id="the-paladins-mount"><a class="header" href="#the-paladins-mount">The Paladin's Mount</a></h2>
<p>The paladin's mount is superior to a normal mount of its kind and has special powers, as described below. The standard mount for a Medium paladin is a heavy warhorse, and the standard mount for a Small paladin is a warpony. Another kind of mount, such as a riding dog (for a halfling paladin) or a Large shark (for a paladin in an aquatic campaign) may be allowed as well.</p>
<p>A paladin's mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects that depend on its type (though it retains an animal's HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).</p>

<p><strong>Paladin's Mount Basics:</strong> Use the base statistics for a creature of the mount's kind, but make changes to take into account the attributes and characteristics summarized on the table and described below.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus HD:</strong> Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve the mount's base attack and base save bonuses. A special mount's base attack bonus is equal to that of a cleric of a level equal to the mount's HD. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's HD). The mount gains additional skill points or feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Armor Adj.:</strong> The number on the table is an improvement to the mount's existing natural armor bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Str Adj.:</strong> Add this figure to the mount's Strength score.</p>
<p><strong>Int:</strong> The mount's Intelligence score.</p>
<p><strong>Empathic Link (Su):</strong> The paladin has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The paladin cannot see through the mount's eyes, but they can communicate empathically.</p>
<p>Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible.</p>
<p>Because of this empathic link, the paladin has the same connection to an item or place that her mount does, just as with a master and his familiar (see Familiars).</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.</p>
<p><strong>Share Spells:</strong> At the paladin's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount. </p>
<p>The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before the duration expires. Additionally, the paladin may cast a spell with a target of &quot;You&quot; on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A paladin and her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount's type (magical beast).</p>
<p><strong>Share Saving Throws:</strong> For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the paladin's, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any other bonuses on saves that the master might have.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Speed (Ex):</strong> The mount's speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Command (Sp):</strong> Once per day per two paladin levels of its master, a mount can use this ability to command other any normal animal of approximately the same kind as itself (for warhorses and warponies, this category includes donkeys, mules, and ponies), as long as the target creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount. This ability functions like the command spell, but the mount must make a DC 21 Concentration check to succeed if it's being ridden at the time. If the check fails, the ability does not work that time, but it still counts against the mount's daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin's level + paladin's Cha modifier) to negate the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Resistance (Ex):</strong> A mount's spell resistance equals its master's paladin level + 5. To affect the mount with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the mount's spell resistance.</p>

<h2 id="class-skills-7"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-7">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The ranger's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Search (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Rope (Dex).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (6 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 6 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-7"><a class="header" href="#class-features-7">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the ranger.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Favored Enemy (Ex):</strong> At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table: Ranger Favored Enemies. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.</p>
<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. </p>
<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>
<p><strong>Track:</strong> A ranger gains Track as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Empathy (Ex):</strong> A ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Style (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character's class features but does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any way.</p>
<p>If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Companion (Ex):</strong> At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures may be added to the ranger's list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind.</p>
<p>This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except that the ranger's effective druid level is one-half his ranger level. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The ranger does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.</p>
<p>A ranger prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though he cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his ranger level.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Combat Style (Ex):</strong> At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>Woodland Stride (Ex):</strong> Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
<p>However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him.</p>
<p><strong>Swift Tracker (Ex):</strong> Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Style Mastery (Ex):</strong> At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Precise Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>Camouflage (Ex):</strong> A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
<p><strong>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):</strong> While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Hide skill even while being observed.</p>

<h2 id="class-skills-8"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-8">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The rogue's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Forgery (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (local) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), Use Magic Device (Cha), and Use Rope (Dex).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (8 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 8 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-8"><a class="header" href="#class-features-8">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the rogue.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
<p><strong>Sneak Attack:</strong> If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
<p>The rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.</p>
<p>Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
<p>With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.</p>
<p>A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies--undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.</p>
<p><strong>Trapfinding:</strong> Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. </p>
<p>Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.</p>
<p>Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.</p>
<p>A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Trap Sense (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.</p>
<p>Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
<p><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.</p>
<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked.</p>
<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.</p>
<p><strong>Crippling Strike (Ex):</strong> A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.</p>
<p><strong>Defensive Roll (Ex):</strong> The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll--if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunist (Ex):</strong> Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue's attack of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can't use the opportunist ability more than once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Mastery:</strong> The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time.</p>
<p><strong>Slippery Mind (Ex):</strong> This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.</p>
<p><strong>Feat:</strong> A rogue may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.</p>

<h2 id="class-skills-9"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-9">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The sorcerer's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (2 + Int modifier) x 4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-9"><a class="header" href="#class-features-9">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer's gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see below).</p>
<p>To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer's Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.</p>
<p>A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. The sorcerer can't use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.</p>
<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer &quot;loses&quot; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can cast. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
<p>Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he'll cast.</p>
<p><strong>Familiar:</strong> A sorcerer can obtain a familiar (see below). Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.</p>
<p>The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.</p>
<p>If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer's experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.</p>
<p>A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.</p>

<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d4.</p>
<h2 id="class-skills-10"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-10">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The wizard's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4: Skills for skill descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (2 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-10"><a class="header" href="#class-features-10">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the wizard.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard's movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A wizard casts arcane spells which are drawn from the sorcerer/ wizard spell list. A wizard must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time (see below).</p>
<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard's Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Wizard. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.</p>
<p>Unlike a bard or sorcerer, a wizard may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting a good night's sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Languages:</strong> A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
<p><strong>Familiar:</strong> A wizard can obtain a familiar in exactly the same manner as a sorcerer can. See the sorcerer description and the information on Familiars below for details.</p>
<p><strong>Scribe Scroll:</strong> At 1st level, a wizard gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. </p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.</p>
<p>These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing these feats.</p>
<p><strong>Spellbooks:</strong> A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic, which all wizards can prepare from memory.</p>
<p>A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited school or schools, if any; see School Specialization, below) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards' spellbooks to her own.</p>
<h2 id="school-specialization"><a class="header" href="#school-specialization">School Specialization</a></h2>
<p>A school is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common theme. If desired, a wizard may specialize in one school of magic (see below). Specialization allows a wizard to cast extra spells from her chosen school, but she then never learns to cast spells from some other schools.</p>
<p>A specialist wizard can prepare one additional spell of her specialty school per spell level each day. She also gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.</p>
<p>The wizard must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose her specialty at 1st level. At this time, she must also give up two other schools of magic (unless she chooses to specialize in divination; see below), which become her prohibited schools.</p>
<p>A wizard can never give up divination to fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>Spells of the prohibited school or schools are not available to the wizard, and she can't even cast such spells from scrolls or fire them from wands. She may not change either her specialization or her prohibited schools later.</p>
<p>The eight schools of arcane magic are abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation.</p>
<p>Spells that do not fall into any of these schools are called universal spells.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abjuration:</strong> Spells that protect, block, or banish. An abjuration specialist is called an abjurer.</li>
<li><strong>Conjuration:</strong> Spells that bring creatures or materials to the caster. A conjuration specialist is called a conjurer.</li>
<li><strong>Divination:</strong> Spells that reveal information. A divination specialist is called a diviner. Unlike the other specialists, a diviner must give up only one other school.</li>
<li><strong>Enchantment:</strong> Spells that imbue the recipient with some property or grant the caster power over another being. An enchantment specialist is called an enchanter.</li>
<li><strong>Evocation:</strong> Spells that manipulate energy or create something from nothing. An evocation specialist is called an evoker.</li>
<li><strong>Illusion:</strong> Spells that alter perception or create false images. An illusion specialist is called an illusionist.</li>
<li><strong>Necromancy:</strong> Spells that manipulate, create, or destroy life or life force. A necromancy specialist is called a necromancer.</li>
<li><strong>Transmutation:</strong> Spells that transform the recipient physically or change its properties in a more subtle way. A transmutation specialist is called a transmuter.</li>
<li><strong>Universal:</strong> Not a school, but a category for spells that all wizards can learn. A wizard cannot select universal as a specialty school or as a prohibited school. Only a limited number of spells fall into this category.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="familiars"><a class="header" href="#familiars">Familiars</a></h2>
<p>A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.</p>
<p>A familiar also grants special abilities to its master (a sorcerer or wizard), as given on the table below. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.</p>
<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master's level.</p>

<h3 id="familiar-basics"><a class="header" href="#familiar-basics">Familiar Basics</a></h3>
<p>Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar's kind, but make the following changes:</p>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal HD total, whichever is higher.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> The familiar has one-half the master's total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.</p>
<p><strong>Attacks:</strong> Use the master's base attack bonus, as calculated from all his classes. Use the familiar's Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the familiar's melee attack bonus with natural weapons.</p>
<p>Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind.</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> For each saving throw, use either the familiar's base save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the master's (as calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or the master's skill ranks, whichever are better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar's total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar's ability to use.</p>
<h3 id="familiar-ability-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#familiar-ability-descriptions">Familiar Ability Descriptions</a></h3>
<p>All familiars have special abilities (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the master's combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table below. The abilities given on the table are cumulative.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Natural Armor Adj.:</strong> The number noted here is an improvement to the familiar's existing natural armor bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Int:</strong> The familiar's Intelligence score.</p>
<p><strong>Alertness (Ex):</strong> While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master gains the Alertness feat.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.</p>
<p><strong>Share Spells:</strong> At the master's option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his familiar. The familiar must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit.</p>
<p>If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the familiar if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the familiar again even if it returns to the master before the duration expires. Additionally, the master may cast a spell with a target of &quot;You&quot; on his familiar (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself.</p>
<p>A master and his familiar can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the familiar's type (magical beast).</p>
<p><strong>Empathic Link (Su):</strong> The master has an empathic link with his familiar out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The master cannot see through the familiar's eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.</p>
<p>Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.</p>
<p><strong>Deliver Touch Spells (Su):</strong> If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the &quot;toucher.&quot; The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.</p>
<p><strong>Speak with Master (Ex):</strong> If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.</p>
<p><strong>Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex):</strong> If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with amphibians, weasels with similar creatures (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks, wolverines, and badgers). Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Resistance (Ex):</strong> If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar's spell resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Scry on Familiar (Sp):</strong> If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the scrying spell) once per day.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="skills"><a class="header" href="#skills">Skills</a></h1>
<p>If you buy a class skill, your character gets 1 rank (equal to a +1 bonus on checks with that skill) for each skill point. If you buy other classes' skills (cross-class skills), you get 1/2 rank per skill point.</p>
<p>Your maximum rank in a class skill is your character level + 3.</p>
<p>Your maximum rank in a cross-class skill is one-half of this number (do not round up or down).</p>
<p><strong>Using Skills:</strong> To make a skill check, roll: 1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier = skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)</p>
<p>This roll works just like an attack roll or a saving throw-- the higher the roll, the better. Either you're trying to match or exceed a certain Difficulty Class (DC), or you're trying to beat another character's check result.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Ranks:</strong> A character's number of ranks in a skill is based on how many skill points a character has invested in a skill. Many skills can be used even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making an untrained skill check.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Modifier:</strong> The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill's key ability (the ability associated with the skill's use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Modifiers:</strong> Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.</p>
<p>Each skill point you spend on a class skill gets you 1 rank in that skill. Class skills are the skills found on your character's class skill list. Each skill point you spend on a cross-class skill gets your character 1/2 rank in that skill. Cross-class skills are skills not found on your character's class skill list. (Half ranks do not improve your skill check, but two 1/2 ranks make 1 rank.) You can't save skill points to spend later.</p>
<p>The maximum rank in a class skill is the character's level + 3. If it's a cross-class skill, the maximum rank is half of that number (do not round up or down).</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a skill is purchased as a class skill or a cross-class skill, if it is a class skill for any of your classes, your maximum rank equals your total character level + 3.</p>
<h2 id="using-skills"><a class="header" href="#using-skills">Using Skills</a></h2>
<p>When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well he or she does. The higher the result of the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.</p>
<p>Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise he or she would fail.</p>
<h2 id="skill-checks"><a class="header" href="#skill-checks">Skill Checks</a></h2>
<p>A skill check takes into account a character's training (skill rank), natural talent (ability modifier), and luck (the die roll). It may also take into account his or her race's knack for doing certain things (racial bonus) or what armor he or she is wearing (armor check penalty), or a certain feat the character possesses, among other things. </p>
<p>To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character's skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the character's ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill's key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply, including racial bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.</p>

<p>Some checks are made against a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC is a number (set using the skill rules as a guideline) that you must score as a result on your skill check in order to succeed.</p>

<p>An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character's check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher skill modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.</p>

<ol>
<li>An Intimidate check is opposed by the target's level check, not a skill check. See the Intimidate skill description for more information.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="trying-again"><a class="header" href="#trying-again">Trying Again</a></h3>
<p>In general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some skills, however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.</p>
<h3 id="untrained-skill-checks"><a class="header" href="#untrained-skill-checks">Untrained Skill Checks</a></h3>
<p>Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill he or she does not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The skill modifier doesn't have a skill rank added in because the character has no ranks in the skill. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the modifier for the skill's key ability, are applied to the check.</p>
<p>Many skills can be used only by someone who is trained in them.</p>
<h3 id="favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions"><a class="header" href="#favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions">Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions</a></h3>
<p>Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.</p>
<p>The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent conditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the skill user a -2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can be subpar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conditions that affect your character's ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check's DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.</p>
<h3 id="time-and-skill-checks"><a class="header" href="#time-and-skill-checks">Time and Skill Checks</a></h3>
<p>Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action.</p>
<p>These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.</p>
<h3 id="checks-without-rolls"><a class="header" href="#checks-without-rolls">Checks without Rolls</a></h3>
<p>A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.</p>
<p>Taking 10: When your character is not being threatened or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure --you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn't help.</p>
<p><strong>Taking 20:</strong> When you have plenty of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one standard action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no penalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, eventually you will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.</p>
<p>Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes twenty times as long as making a single check would take.</p>
<p>Since taking 20 assumes that the character will fail many times before succeeding, if you did attempt to take 20 on a skill that carries penalties for failure, your character would automatically incur those penalties before he or she could complete the task. Common &quot;take 20&quot; skills include Escape Artist, Open Lock, and Search.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Checks and Caster Level Checks:</strong> The normal take 10 and take 20 rules apply for ability checks. Neither rule applies to caster level checks.</p>
<h2 id="combining-skill-attempts"><a class="header" href="#combining-skill-attempts">Combining Skill Attempts</a></h2>
<p>When more than one character tries the same skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may overlap.</p>
<h3 id="individual-events"><a class="header" href="#individual-events">Individual Events</a></h3>
<p>Often, several characters attempt some action and each succeeds or fails independently.  The result of one character's Climb check does not influence the results of other characters Climb check.</p>
<h3 id="aid-another"><a class="header" href="#aid-another">Aid Another</a></h3>
<p>You can help another character achieve success on his or her skill check by making the same kind of skill check in a cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to his or her check, as per the rule for favorable conditions. (You can't take 10 on a skill check to aid another.) In many cases, a character's help won't be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once. </p>
<p>In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you can't aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn't achieve alone.</p>
<h2 id="skill-synergy"><a class="header" href="#skill-synergy">Skill Synergy</a></h2>
<p>It's possible for a character to have two skills that work well together. In general, having 5 or more ranks in one skill gives the character a +2 bonus on skill checks with each of its synergistic skills, as noted in the skill description. In some cases, this bonus applies only to specific uses of the skill in question, and not to all checks. Some skills provide benefits on other checks made by a character, such as those checks required to use certain class features.</p>
<h2 id="ability-checks"><a class="header" href="#ability-checks">Ability Checks</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes a character tries to do something to which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate ability modifier. Essentially, you're making an untrained skill check. </p>
<p>In some cases, an action is a straight test of one's ability with no luck involved. Just as you wouldn't make a height check to see who is taller, you don't make a Strength check to see who is stronger.</p>
<h2 id="skill-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#skill-descriptions">Skill Descriptions</a></h2>
<p>This section describes each skill, including common uses and typical modifiers. Characters can sometimes use skills for purposes other than those noted here.</p>
<p>Here is the format for skill descriptions.</p>
<h1 id="skill-name"><a class="header" href="#skill-name">SKILL NAME</a></h1>
<p>The skill name line includes (in addition to the name of the skill) the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Ability:</strong> The abbreviation of the ability whose modifier applies to the skill check. Exception: Speak Language has &quot;None&quot; as its key ability because the use of this skill does not require a check.</li>
<li><strong>Trained Only:</strong> If this notation is included in the skill name line, you must have at least 1 rank in the skill to use it. If it is omitted, the skill can be used untrained (with a rank of 0). If any special notes apply to trained or untrained use, they are covered in the Untrained section (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Armor Check Penalty:</strong> If this notation is included in the skill name line, an armor check penalty applies (when appropriate) to checks using this skill. If this entry is absent, an armor check penalty does not apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill name line is followed by a general description of what using the skill represents. After the description are a few other types of information:</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> What a character (&quot;you&quot; in the skill description) can do with a successful skill check and the check's DC.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> The type of action using the skill requires, or the amount of time required for a check.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Any conditions that apply to successive attempts to use the skill successfully. If the skill doesn't allow you to attempt the same task more than once, or if failure carries an inherent penalty (such as with the Climb skill), you can't take 20. If this paragraph is omitted, the skill can be retried without any inherent penalty, other than the additional time required.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Any extra facts that apply to the skill, such as special effects deriving from its use or bonuses that certain characters receive because of class, feat choices, or race.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> Some skills grant a bonus to the use of one or more other skills because of a synergistic effect. This entry, when present, indicates what bonuses this skill may grant or receive because of such synergies. See Table 4-5 for a complete list of bonuses granted by synergy between skills (or between a skill and a class feature).</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> The full utility of certain skills is restricted to characters of certain classes or characters who possess certain feats. This entry indicates whether any such restrictions exist for the skill.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> This entry indicates what a character without at least 1 rank in the skill can do with it. If this entry doesn't appear, it means that the skill functions normally for untrained characters (if it can be used untrained) or that an untrained character can't attempt checks with this skill (for skills that are designated as &quot;Trained Only&quot;).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="appraise-int"><a class="header" href="#appraise-int">Appraise (Int)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual value.</p>
<p>Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item's value.</p>
<p>A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed, such as a gem. A merchant's scale gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals.</p>
<p>These bonuses stack.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions).</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> No. You cannot try again on the same object, regardless of success.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A dwarf gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items because dwarves are familiar with valuable items of all kinds (especially those made of stone or metal).</p>
<p>The master of a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks.</p>
<p>A character with the Diligent feat gets a +2 bonus on Appraise checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 ranks in any Craft skill, you gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> For common items, failure on an untrained check means no estimate. For rare items, success means an estimate of 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="balance-dex-armor-check-penalty"><a class="header" href="#balance-dex-armor-check-penalty">Balance (Dex; Armor Check Penalty)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can't move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface, as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Narrow Surface</th><th align="center">Balance DC<sup>1</sup></th><th align="left">Difficult Surface</th><th align="center">Balance DC<sup>1</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody>

</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Add modifiers from Narrow Surface Modifiers, below, as appropriate.</li>
<li>Only if running or charging. Failure by 4 or less means the character can't run or charge, but may otherwise act normally.</li>
</ol>
<p>Narrow Surface Modifiers (These modifiers stack)</p>

<tr><td align="left">Sloped or angled</td><td align="center">+2</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Add the appropriate modifier to the Balance DC of a narrow surface.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Being Attacked while Balancing:</strong> You are considered flat-footed while balancing, since you can't move to avoid a blow, and thus you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you aren't considered flat-footed while balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Balance check against the same DC to remain standing.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerated Movement:</strong> You can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a -5 penalty, you can move your full speed as a move action. (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each move action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to charge across a precarious surface; charging requires one Balance check for each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof ) that you charge.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> None. A Balance check doesn't require an action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bluff-cha"><a class="header" href="#bluff-cha">Bluff (Cha)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> A Bluff check is opposed by the target's Sense Motive check. See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target's Sense Motive check for each one.</p>
<p>Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it's important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn't believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn't so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.</p>
<p>A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a suggestion spell. </p>
<p>A bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.</p>
<p><strong>Feinting in Combat:</strong> You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can't dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target's Sense Motive check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers.</p>
<p>If your Bluff check result exceeds this special Sense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your next turn.</p>
<p>Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it's harder to read a strange creature's body language; you take a -4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it's even harder; you take a -8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it's impossible.</p>
<p>Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Diversion to Hide:</strong> You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Delivering a Secret Message:</strong> You can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can't get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see Sense Motive).</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A Bluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a standard action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn't take an action; it is part of normal communication.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per round.</p>
<p>Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>
<p>The master of a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
<p>If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand checks, as well as on Disguise checks made when you know you're being observed and you try to act in character.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="climb-str-armor-check-penalty"><a class="header" href="#climb-str-armor-check-penalty">Climb (Str; Armor Check Penalty)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.</p>
<p>A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.</p>
<p>A climber's kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks.</p>
<p>The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb. Compare the task with those on the following table to determine an appropriate DC.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="center">Climb DC</th><th>Example Surface or Activity</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="center">0</td><td>A slope too steep to walk up, or a knotted rope with a wall to brace against.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">5</td><td>A rope with a wall to brace against, or a knotted rope, or a rope affected by the rope trick spell.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">10</td><td>A surface with ledges to hold on to and stand on, such as a very rough wall or a ship's rigging.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">15</td><td>Any surface with adequate handholds and footholds (natural or artificial), such as a very rough natural rock surface or a tree, or an unknotted rope, or pulling yourself up when dangling by your hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">20</td><td>An uneven surface with some narrow handholds and footholds, such as a typical wall in a dungeon or ruins.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">25</td><td>A rough surface, such as a natural rock wall or a brick wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">25</td><td>An overhang or ceiling with handholds but no footholds.</td></tr>

<table><thead><tr><th align="center">Climb DC Modifier<sup>1</sup></th><th>Example Surface or Activity</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="center">-10</td><td>Climbing a chimney (artificial or natural) or other location where you can brace against two opposite walls (reduces DC by 10).</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">-5</td><td>Climbing a corner where you can brace against perpendicular walls (reduces DC by 5).</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">+5</td><td>Surface is slippery (increases DC by 5).</td></tr>

<ol>
<li>These modifiers are cumulative; use any that apply.</li>
</ol>
<p>You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand. While climbing, you can't move to avoid a blow, so you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can't use a shield while climbing.</p>
<p>Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerated Climbing:</strong> You try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a -5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter your speed).</p>
<p><strong>Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds:</strong> You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.</p>
<p><strong>Catching Yourself When Falling:</strong> It's practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 20) to do so. It's much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope's DC + 10).</p>
<p><strong>Catching a Falling Character While Climbing:</strong> If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character's fall but don't lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character's fall and begin falling as well.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Climbing is part of movement, so it's generally part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn't take an action.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can use a rope to haul a character upward (or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum load in this manner.</p>
<p>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks because halflings are agile and surefooted.</p>
<p>The master of a lizard familiar gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks.</p>
<p>If you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks.</p>
<p>A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher than 0, but it always can choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. Such a creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="concentration-con"><a class="header" href="#concentration-con">Concentration (Con)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity. In general, if an action wouldn't normally provoke an attack of opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted.</p>
<p>If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a spell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were using a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other ramifications as well.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the spell you are trying to cast to the appropriate Concentration DC. If more than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each one; any failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not completed.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you are trying to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell when the distraction occurs, add the level of the spell to the indicated DC.</li>
<li>Such as during the casting of a spell with a casting time of 1 round or more, or the execution of an activity that takes more than a single full-round action (such as Disable Device). Also, damage stemming from an attack of opportunity or readied attack made in response to the spell being cast (for spells with a casting time of 1 action) or the action being taken (for activities requiring no more than a full-round action).</li>
<li>Such as from acid arrow.</li>
<li>If the spell allows no save, use the save DC it would have if it did allow a save.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> None. Making a Concentration check doesn't take an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively).</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, though a success doesn't cancel the effect of a previous failure, such as the loss of a spell you were casting or the disruption of a spell you were concentrating on.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can use Concentration to cast a spell, use a spell-like ability, or use a skill defensively, so as to avoid attacks of opportunity altogether. This doesn't apply to other actions that might provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>The DC of the check is 15 (plus the spell's level, if casting a spell or using a spell-like ability defensively). If the Concentration check succeeds, you may attempt the action normally without provoking any attacks of opportunity. A successful Concentration check still doesn't allow you to take 10 on another check if you are in a stressful situation; you must make the check normally. If the Concentration check fails, the related action also automatically fails (with any appropriate ramifications), and the action is wasted, just as if your concentration had been disrupted by a distraction. </p>
<p>A character with the Combat Casting feat gets a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while on the defensive or while grappling or pinned.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="craft-int"><a class="header" href="#craft-int">Craft (Int)</a></h1>
<p>Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.</p>
<p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill.</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft's daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p>
<p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item's finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.</p>
<p>In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.</p>
<p>When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p>
<p>All crafts require artisan's tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a -2 circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan's tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>
<p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the item's price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the DC from the table below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay one-third of the item's price for the cost of raw materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week's work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result x the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result x the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you've completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result x the DC doesn't equal the price, then it represents the progress you've made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week.</p>
<p>If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
<p><strong>Progress by the Day:</strong> You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result x DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Masterwork Items:</strong> You can make a masterwork item--a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.</p>
<p><strong>Repairing Items:</strong> Generally, you can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item's price. </p>
<p>When you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of item, the DC for checks involving the creation of that item are typically as given on the following table.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Item</th><th align="center">Craft Skill</th><th align="center">Craft DC</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<ol>
<li>You must be a spellcaster to craft any of these items.</li>
<li>Traps have their own rules for construction.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Does not apply. Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A dwarf has a +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal, because dwarves are especially capable with stonework and metalwork.</p>
<p>A gnome has a +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because gnomes have sensitive noses.</p>
<p>You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item. This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you'll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.</p>
<p>To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment and be a spellcaster. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist's lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 ranks in a Craft skill, you get a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="decipher-script-int-trained-only"><a class="header" href="#decipher-script-int-trained-only">Decipher Script (Int; Trained Only)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing.</p>
<p>If the check succeeds, you understand the general content of a piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check fails, make a DC 5 Wisdom check to see if you avoid drawing a false conclusion about the text. (Success means that you do not draw a false conclusion; failure means that you do.)</p>
<p>Both the Decipher Script check and (if necessary) the Wisdom check are made secretly, so that you can't tell whether the conclusion you draw is true or false.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Deciphering the equivalent of a single page of script takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions).</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A character with the Diligent feat gets a +2 bonus on Decipher Script checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks involving scrolls.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="diplomacy-cha"><a class="header" href="#diplomacy-cha">Diplomacy (Cha)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can change the attitudes of others (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check; see the Influencing NPC Attitudes sidebar, below, for basic DCs. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and the winner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when two advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a third party.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Changing others' attitudes with Diplomacy generally takes at least 1 full minute (10 consecutive full-round actions). In some situations, this time requirement may greatly increase. A rushed Diplomacy check can be made as a full-round action, but you take a -10 penalty on the check.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial Diplomacy check succeeds, the other character can be persuaded only so far, and a retry may do more harm than good. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly committed to his position, and a retry is futile.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>
<p>If you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, Knowledge (nobility and royalty), or Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>

<p><strong>Check:</strong> The Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don't necessarily know whether you've succeeded.</p>
<p>The DC depends on how tricky the device is. Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a fairly simple device has a DC of 10; more intricate and complex devices have higher DCs.</p>
<p>If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. If you're attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.</p>
<p>You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).</p>

<ol>
<li>If you attempt to leave behind no trace of your tampering, add 5 to the DC.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a full-round action. An intricate or complex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. You can retry if you have missed the check by 4 or less, though you must be aware that you have failed in order to try again.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Nimble Fingers feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disable Device checks.</p>
<p>A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more can study the trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (along with her companions) without disarming it.</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> Rogues (and other characters with the trapfinding class feature) can disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create it.</p>
<p>The spells fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol, and teleportation circle also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a successful Disable Device check. Spike growth and spike stones, however, create magic traps against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.</p>
<h2 id="other-ways-to-beat-a-trap"><a class="header" href="#other-ways-to-beat-a-trap">Other Ways To Beat A Trap</a></h2>
<p>It's possible to ruin many traps without making a Disable Device check.</p>
<p><strong>Ranged Attack Traps:</strong> Once a trap's location is known, the obvious way to ruin it is to smash the mechanism--assuming the mechanism can be accessed. Failing that, it's possible to plug up the holes from which the projectiles emerge. Doing this prevents the trap from firing unless its ammunition does enough damage to break through the plugs.</p>
<p><strong>Melee Attack Traps:</strong> These devices can be thwarted by smashing the mechanism or blocking the weapons, as noted above. Alternatively, if a character studies the trap as it triggers, he might be able to time his dodges just right to avoid damage. A character who is doing nothing but studying a trap when it first goes off gains a +4 dodge bonus against its attacks if it is triggered again within the next minute.</p>
<p><strong>Pits:</strong> Disabling a pit trap generally ruins only the trapdoor, making it an uncovered pit. Filling in the pit or building a makeshift bridge across it is an application of manual labor, not the Disable Device skill. Characters could neutralize any spikes at the bottom of a pit by attacking them--they break just as daggers do.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Traps:</strong> Dispel magic helps here. Someone who succeeds on a caster level check against the level of the trap's creator suppresses the trap for 1d4 rounds. This works only with a targeted dispel magic, not the area version (see the spell description).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="disguise-cha"><a class="header" href="#disguise-cha">Disguise (Cha)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others' Spot check results. If you don't draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Spot checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Spot checks.</p>
<p>You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people are making Spot checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can't be sure how good the result is.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of your disguise depends in part on how much you're attempting to change your appearance.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Disguise</th><th align="center">Disguise Check Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<ol>
<li>These modifiers are cumulative; use any that apply.</li>
<li>Per step of difference between your actual age category and your disguised age category. The steps are: young (younger than adulthood), adulthood, middle age, old, and venerable.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like get a bonus on their Spot checks according to the table below. Furthermore, they are automatically considered to be suspicious of you, so opposed checks are always called for.</p>

<p>Usually, an individual makes a Spot check to see through your disguise immediately upon meeting you and each hour thereafter. If you casually meet many different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average Spot modifier for the group. </p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Creating a disguise requires 1d3x10 minutes of work.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. You may try to redo a failed disguise, but once others know that a disguise was attempted, they'll be more suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Magic that alters your form, such as alter self, disguise self, polymorph, or shapechange, grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks (see the individual spell descriptions). You must succeed on a Disguise check with a +10 bonus to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual using the veil spell. Divination magic that allows people to see through illusions (such as true seeing) does not penetrate a mundane disguise, but it can negate the magical component of a magically enhanced one.</p>
<p>You must make a Disguise check when you cast a simulacrum spell to determine how good the likeness is.</p>
<p>If you have the Deceitful feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disguise checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Disguise checks when you know that you're being observed and you try to act in character.</p>

<p><strong>Check:</strong> The table below gives the DCs to escape various forms of restraints.</p>
<p><strong>Ropes:</strong> Your Escape Artist check is opposed by the binder's Use Rope check. Since it's easier to tie someone up than to escape from being tied up, the binder gets a +10 bonus on his or her check.</p>
<p>Manacles and Masterwork Manacles: The DC for manacles is set by their construction.</p>
<p><strong>Tight Space:</strong> The DC noted on the table is for getting through a space where your head fits but your shoulders don't. If the space is long you may need to make multiple checks. You can't get through a space that your head does not fit through.</p>
<p><strong>Grappler:</strong> You can make an Escape Artist check opposed by your enemy's grapple check to get out of a grapple or out of a pinned condition (so that you're only grappling).</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Making an Escape Artist check to escape from rope bindings, manacles, or other restraints (except a grappler) requires 1 minute of work. Escaping from a net or an animate rope, command plants, control plants, or entangle spell is a full-round action. Escaping from a grapple or pin is a standard action. Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on how long the space is.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. You can make another check after a failed check if you're squeezing your way through a tight space, making multiple checks. If the situation permits, you can make additional checks, or even take 20, as long as you're not being actively opposed.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks to bind someone.</p>

<p><strong>Check:</strong> Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged, enough light or sufficient visual acuity to see the details of what you're writing, wax for seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a government decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that person's handwriting is needed.</p>
<p>The Forgery check is made secretly, so that you're not sure how good your forgery is. As with Disguise, you don't even need to make a check until someone examines the work. Your Forgery check is opposed by the Forgery check of the person who examines the document to check its authenticity. The examiner gains modifiers on his or her check if any of the conditions on the table below exist.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Condition</th><th align="center">Reader's Forgery Check Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Type of document unknown to reader</td><td align="center">-2</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<p>A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous knowledge, or one that requires sacrifice on the part of the person checking the document can increase that character's suspicion (and thus create favorable circumstances for the checker's opposing Forgery check).</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Forging a very short and simple document takes about 1 minute. A longer or more complex document takes 1d4 minutes per page.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Usually, no. A retry is never possible after a particular reader detects a particular forgery. But the document created by the forger might still fool someone else. The result of a Forgery check for a particular document must be used for every instance of a different reader examining the document. No reader can attempt to detect a particular forgery more than once; if that one opposed check goes in favor of the forger, then the reader can't try using his own skill again, even if he's suspicious about the document.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Deceitful feat, you get a +2 bonus on Forgery checks.</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> Forgery is language-dependent; thus, to forge documents and detect forgeries, you must be able to read and write the language in question. A barbarian can't learn the Forgery skill unless he has learned to read and write.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="gather-information-cha"><a class="header" href="#gather-information-cha">Gather Information (Cha)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> An evening's time, a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making friends, and a DC 10 Gather Information check get you a general idea of a city's major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would be withheld. The higher your check result, the better the information.</p>
<p>If you want to find out about a specific rumor, or a specific item, or obtain a map, or do something else along those lines, the DC for the check is 15 to 25, or even higher.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> A typical Gather Information check takes 1d4+1 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, but it takes time for each check. Furthermore, you may draw attention to yourself if you repeatedly pursue a certain type of information.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Gather Information checks.</p>
<p>If you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks.</p>

<p><strong>Handle an Animal:</strong> This task involves commanding an animal to perform a task or trick that it knows. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Push&quot; an Animal:</strong> To push an animal means to get it to perform a task or trick that it doesn't know but is physically capable of performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p>
<p><strong>Teach an Animal a Trick:</strong> You can teach an animal a specific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal check against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following.</p>
<p><strong>Attack (DC 20):</strong> The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks.</p>
<p><strong>Come (DC 15):</strong> The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.</p>
<p><strong>Defend (DC 20):</strong> The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character.</p>
<p><strong>Down (DC 15):</strong> The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn't know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.</p>
<p><strong>Fetch (DC 15):</strong> The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.</p>
<p><strong>Guard (DC 20):</strong> The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.</p>
<p><strong>Heel (DC 15):</strong> The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn't go.</p>
<p><strong>Perform (DC 15):</strong> The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Seek (DC 15):</strong> The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.</p>
<p><strong>Stay (DC 15):</strong> The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.</p>
<p><strong>Track (DC 20):</strong> The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the scent ability)</p>
<p><strong>Work (DC 15):</strong> The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.</p>
<p><strong>Train an Animal for a Purpose:</strong> Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal's purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.</p>
<p>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time. </p>
<p><strong>Combat Riding (DC 20):</strong> An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also &quot;upgrade&quot; an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal's previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and riding dogs are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they don't require any additional training for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Fighting (DC 20):</strong> An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Guarding (DC 20):</strong> An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Labor (DC 15):</strong> An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Hunting (DC 20):</strong> An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes six weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Performance (DC 15):</strong> An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes five weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Riding (DC 15):</strong> An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Rear a Wild Animal:</strong> To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once.</p>
<p>A successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it's being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Handling an animal is a move action, while pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can handle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, except for rearing an animal.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can use this skill on a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks known as animals do.</p>
<p>A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal checks involving her animal companion.</p>
<p>In addition, a druid's or ranger's animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which don't count against the normal limit on tricks known and don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks to teach.</p>
<p>If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks and wild empathy checks.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you can't teach, rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no ranks in Handle Animal can use a Charisma check to handle and push her animal companion, but she can't teach, rear, or train other nondomestic animals.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>First Aid:</strong> You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them.</p>
<p><strong>Long-Term Care:</strong> Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to ability damage) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.</p>
<p>You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Treat Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones:</strong> A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at one-half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.</p>
<p>A creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim's injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.</p>
<p><strong>Treat Poison:</strong> To treat poison means to tend a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.</p>
<p><strong>Treat Disease:</strong> To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased character. Every time he or she makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell takes 10 minutes of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. Generally speaking, you can't try a Heal check again without proof of the original check's failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A character with the Self-Sufficient feat gets a +2 bonus on Heal checks.</p>
<p>A healer's kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hide-dex-armor-check-penalty"><a class="header" href="#hide-dex-armor-check-penalty">Hide (Dex; Armor Check Penalty)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Your Hide check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone who might see you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your normal speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging.</p>
<p>A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large -4, Huge -8, Gargantuan -12, Colossal -16.</p>
<p>You need cover or concealment in order to attempt a Hide check. Total cover or total concealment usually (but not always; see Special, below) obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can see you anyway.</p>
<p>If people are observing you, even casually, you can't hide. You can run around a corner or behind cover so that you're out of sight and then hide, but the others then know at least where you went.</p>
<p>If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check; see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in Hide.) This check, however, is made at a -10 penalty because you have to move fast.</p>
<p><strong>Sniping:</strong> If you've already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack, then immediately hide again. You take a -20 penalty on your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Diversion to Hide:</strong> You can use Bluff to help you hide. A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check as part of movement, so it doesn't take a separate action. However, hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if you're moving.</p>
<p>If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Hide checks.</p>
<p>A 13th-level ranger can attempt a Hide check in any sort of natural terrain, even if it doesn't grant cover or concealment. A 17thlevel ranger can do this even while being observed.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="skills-1"><a class="header" href="#skills-1">Skills</a></h1>
<p>If you buy a class skill, your character gets 1 rank (equal to a +1 bonus on checks with that skill) for each skill point. If you buy other classes' skills (cross-class skills), you get 1/2 rank per skill point.</p>
<p>Your maximum rank in a class skill is your character level + 3.</p>
<p>Your maximum rank in a cross-class skill is one-half of this number (do not round up or down).</p>
<p><strong>Using Skills:</strong> To make a skill check, roll: 1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier = skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)</p>
<p>This roll works just like an attack roll or a saving throw-- the higher the roll, the better. Either you're trying to match or exceed a certain Difficulty Class (DC), or you're trying to beat another character's check result.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Ranks:</strong> A character's number of ranks in a skill is based on how many skill points a character has invested in a skill. Many skills can be used even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making an untrained skill check.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Modifier:</strong> The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill's key ability (the ability associated with the skill's use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Modifiers:</strong> Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.</p>
<p>Each skill point you spend on a class skill gets you 1 rank in that skill. Class skills are the skills found on your character's class skill list. Each skill point you spend on a cross-class skill gets your character 1/2 rank in that skill. Cross-class skills are skills not found on your character's class skill list. (Half ranks do not improve your skill check, but two 1/2 ranks make 1 rank.) You can't save skill points to spend later.</p>
<p>The maximum rank in a class skill is the character's level + 3. If it's a cross-class skill, the maximum rank is half of that number (do not round up or down).</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a skill is purchased as a class skill or a cross-class skill, if it is a class skill for any of your classes, your maximum rank equals your total character level + 3.</p>
<h2 id="using-skills-1"><a class="header" href="#using-skills-1">Using Skills</a></h2>
<p>When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well he or she does. The higher the result of the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.</p>
<p>Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise he or she would fail.</p>
<h2 id="skill-checks-1"><a class="header" href="#skill-checks-1">Skill Checks</a></h2>
<p>A skill check takes into account a character's training (skill rank), natural talent (ability modifier), and luck (the die roll). It may also take into account his or her race's knack for doing certain things (racial bonus) or what armor he or she is wearing (armor check penalty), or a certain feat the character possesses, among other things. </p>
<p>To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character's skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the character's ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill's key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply, including racial bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.</p>
<h3 id="difficulty-class-1"><a class="header" href="#difficulty-class-1">Difficulty Class</a></h3>
<p>Some checks are made against a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC is a number (set using the skill rules as a guideline) that you must score as a result on your skill check in order to succeed.</p>

<p>An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character's check result.

<h3 id="trying-again-1"><a class="header" href="#trying-again-1">Trying Again</a></h3>
<p>In general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some skills, however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.</p>
<h3 id="untrained-skill-checks-1"><a class="header" href="#untrained-skill-checks-1">Untrained Skill Checks</a></h3>
<p>Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill he or she does not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The skill modifier doesn't have a skill rank added in because the character has no ranks in the skill. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the modifier for the skill's key ability, are applied to the check.</p>
<p>Many skills can be used only by someone who is trained in them.</p>
<h3 id="favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions-1"><a class="header" href="#favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions-1">Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions</a></h3>
<p>Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.</p>
<p>The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent conditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the skill user a -2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can be subpar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conditions that affect your character's ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check's DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.</p>
<h3 id="time-and-skill-checks-1"><a class="header" href="#time-and-skill-checks-1">Time and Skill Checks</a></h3>
<p>Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action.</p>
<p>These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.</p>
<h3 id="checks-without-rolls-1"><a class="header" href="#checks-without-rolls-1">Checks without Rolls</a></h3>
<p>A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.</p>
<p>Taking 10: When your character is not being threatened or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure --you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn't help.</p>
<p><strong>Taking 20:</strong> When you have plenty of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one standard action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no penalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, eventually you will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.</p>
<p>Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes twenty times as long as making a single check would take.</p>
<p>Since taking 20 assumes that the character will fail many times before succeeding, if you did attempt to take 20 on a skill that carries penalties for failure, your character would automatically incur those penalties before he or she could complete the task. Common &quot;take 20&quot; skills include Escape Artist, Open Lock, and Search.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Checks and Caster Level Checks:</strong> The normal take 10 and take 20 rules apply for ability checks. Neither rule applies to caster level checks.</p>
<h2 id="combining-skill-attempts-1"><a class="header" href="#combining-skill-attempts-1">Combining Skill Attempts</a></h2>
<p>When more than one character tries the same skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may overlap.</p>
<h3 id="individual-events-1"><a class="header" href="#individual-events-1">Individual Events</a></h3>
<p>Often, several characters attempt some action and each succeeds or fails independently.  The result of one character's Climb check does not influence the results of other characters Climb check.</p>
<h3 id="aid-another-1"><a class="header" href="#aid-another-1">Aid Another</a></h3>
<p>You can help another character achieve success on his or her skill check by making the same kind of skill check in a cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to his or her check, as per the rule for favorable conditions. (You can't take 10 on a skill check to aid another.) In many cases, a character's help won't be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once. </p>
<p>In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you can't aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn't achieve alone.</p>
<h2 id="skill-synergy-1"><a class="header" href="#skill-synergy-1">Skill Synergy</a></h2>
<p>It's possible for a character to have two skills that work well together. In general, having 5 or more ranks in one skill gives the character a +2 bonus on skill checks with each of its synergistic skills, as noted in the skill description. In some cases, this bonus applies only to specific uses of the skill in question, and not to all checks. Some skills provide benefits on other checks made by a character, such as those checks required to use certain class features.</p>
<h2 id="ability-checks-1"><a class="header" href="#ability-checks-1">Ability Checks</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes a character tries to do something to which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate ability modifier. Essentially, you're making an untrained skill check. </p>
<p>In some cases, an action is a straight test of one's ability with no luck involved. Just as you wouldn't make a height check to see who is taller, you don't make a Strength check to see who is stronger.</p>
<h2 id="skill-descriptions-1"><a class="header" href="#skill-descriptions-1">Skill Descriptions</a></h2>
<p>This section describes each skill, including common uses and typical modifiers. Characters can sometimes use skills for purposes other than those noted here.</p>
<p>Here is the format for skill descriptions.</p>
<h1 id="skill-name-1"><a class="header" href="#skill-name-1">SKILL NAME</a></h1>
<p>The skill name line includes (in addition to the name of the skill) the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Ability:</strong> The abbreviation of the ability whose modifier applies to the skill check. Exception: Speak Language has &quot;None&quot; as its key ability because the use of this skill does not require a check.</li>
<li><strong>Trained Only:</strong> If this notation is included in the skill name line, you must have at least 1 rank in the skill to use it. If it is omitted, the skill can be used untrained (with a rank of 0). If any special notes apply to trained or untrained use, they are covered in the Untrained section (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Armor Check Penalty:</strong> If this notation is included in the skill name line, an armor check penalty applies (when appropriate) to checks using this skill. If this entry is absent, an armor check penalty does not apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill name line is followed by a general description of what using the skill represents. After the description are a few other types of information:</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> What a character (&quot;you&quot; in the skill description) can do with a successful skill check and the check's DC.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> The type of action using the skill requires, or the amount of time required for a check.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Any conditions that apply to successive attempts to use the skill successfully. If the skill doesn't allow you to attempt the same task more than once, or if failure carries an inherent penalty (such as with the Climb skill), you can't take 20. If this paragraph is omitted, the skill can be retried without any inherent penalty, other than the additional time required.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Any extra facts that apply to the skill, such as special effects deriving from its use or bonuses that certain characters receive because of class, feat choices, or race.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> Some skills grant a bonus to the use of one or more other skills because of a synergistic effect. This entry, when present, indicates what bonuses this skill may grant or receive because of such synergies. See Table 4-5 for a complete list of bonuses granted by synergy between skills (or between a skill and a class feature).</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> The full utility of certain skills is restricted to characters of certain classes or characters who possess certain feats. This entry indicates whether any such restrictions exist for the skill.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> This entry indicates what a character without at least 1 rank in the skill can do with it. If this entry doesn't appear, it means that the skill functions normally for untrained characters (if it can be used untrained) or that an untrained character can't attempt checks with this skill (for skills that are designated as &quot;Trained Only&quot;).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="intimidate-cha"><a class="header" href="#intimidate-cha">Intimidate (Cha)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can change another's behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target's modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus [if any] + target's modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target's check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and for 1d6x10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target's default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile).</p>
<p>If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Demoralize Opponent:</strong> You can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent's resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate check opposed by the target's modified level check (see above). If you win, the target becomes shaken for 1 round. A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that can see you.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Changing another's behavior requires 1 minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a standard action.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn't help. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is futile.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are larger than your target. Conversely, you take a -4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are smaller than your target.</p>
<p>A character immune to fear can't be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent creatures.</p>
<p>If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="jump-str-armor-check-penalty"><a class="header" href="#jump-str-armor-check-penalty">Jump (Str; Armor Check Penalty)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below).</p>
<p>Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a -6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.</p>
<p>All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.</p>
<p>Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round.</p>
<p>If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.</p>
<p><strong>Long Jump:</strong> A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).</p>
<p>If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don't clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.</p>

<ol>
<li>Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>High Jump:</strong> A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high above or to grasp something overhead. The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared.</p>
<p>If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped. As with a long jump, the DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.</p>
<p>| High Jump Distance<sup>1</sup>  | | Jump DC<sup>2</sup> | |  |
| 1 foot  | | 4 | |  |
| 2 feet  | | 8 | |  |

<ol>
<li>Not including vertical reach; see below.</li>
<li>Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to the size of the character or creature. The maximum vertical reach (height the creature can reach without jumping) for an average creature of a given size is shown on the table below. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.)</p>
<p>Quadrupedal creatures don't have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature; treat them as being one size category smaller.</p>

<p><strong>Hop Up:</strong> You can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.</p>
<p><strong>Jumping Down:</strong> If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.</p>
<p>If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> None. A Jump check is included in your movement, so it is part of a move action. If you run out of movement mid-jump, your next action (either on this turn or, if necessary, on your next turn) must be a move action to complete the jump.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Effects that increase your movement also increase your jumping distance, since your check is modified by your speed.</p>
<p>If you have the Run feat, you get a +4 bonus on Jump checks for any jumps made after a running start.</p>
<p>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Jump checks because halflings are agile and athletic.</p>
<p>If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="knowledge-int-trained-only"><a class="header" href="#knowledge-int-trained-only">Knowledge (Int; Trained Only)</a></h1>
<p>Like the Craft and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills. Knowledge represents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even scientific discipline.</p>
<p>Below are listed typical fields of study.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)</li>
<li>Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)</li>
<li>Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)</li>
<li>Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)</li>
<li>History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)</li>
<li>Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)</li>
<li>Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)</li>
<li>Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees, mottoes, personalities)</li>
<li>Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)</li>
<li>The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the planes)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).</p>
<p>In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster's HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster.</p>
<p>For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge check doesn't take an action--you simply know the answer or you don't.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn't let you know something that you never learned in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana), you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), you get a +2 bonus on Search checks made to find secret doors or hidden compartments.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), you get a +2 bonus on bardic knowledge checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (local), you get a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made in aboveground natural environments (aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, or plains).</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nobility and royalty), you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion), you get a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while underground.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> An untrained Knowledge check is simply an Intelligence check. Without actual training, you know only common knowledge (DC 10 or lower).</p>

<p>In the case of people trying to be quiet, the DCs given on the table could be replaced by Move Silently checks, in which case the indicated DC would be their average check result. </p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Every time you have a chance to hear something in a reactive manner (such as when someone makes a noise or you move into a new area), you can make a Listen check without using an action. Trying to hear something you failed to hear previously is a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. You can try to hear something that you failed to hear previously with no penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> When several characters are listening to the same thing, a single 1d20 roll can be used for all the individuals' Listen checks.</p>
<p>A fascinated creature takes a -4 penalty on Listen checks made as reactions.</p>

<p>A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks that involve its use.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening's work to a full day's performance. The bard's special Perform-based abilities are described in that class's description.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don't negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A bard must have at least 3 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire courage in his allies, or to use his countersong or his fascinate ability. A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire competence, 9 ranks to use his suggestion ability, 12 ranks to inspire greatness, 15 ranks to use his song of freedom ability, 18 ranks to inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his mass suggestion ability. See Bardic Music in the bard class description.</p>

<p>Like Craft, Knowledge, and Perform, Profession is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Profession skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill. While a Craft skill represents ability in creating or making an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. </p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your Profession check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the profession's daily tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how to handle common problems.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Not applicable. A single check generally represents a week of work.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill to earn an income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly wage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a week to determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt to accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> Untrained laborers and assistants (that is, characters without any ranks in Profession) earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ride-dex"><a class="header" href="#ride-dex">Ride (Dex)</a></h1>
<p>If you attempt to ride a creature that is ill suited as a mount, you take a -5 penalty on your Ride checks.</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Typical riding actions don't require checks. You can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount from a mount without a problem.</p>
<p>The following tasks do require checks.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Task</th><th align="center">Ride DC</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Guide with knees</td><td align="center">5</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Fast mount or dismount</td><td align="center">20<sup>1</sup></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Armor check penalty applies.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Guide with Knees:</strong> You can react instantly to guide your mount with your knees so that you can use both hands in combat. Make your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand this round because you need to use the other to control your mount.</p>
<p><strong>Stay in Saddle:</strong> You can react instantly to try to avoid falling when your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when you take damage. This usage does not take an action.</p>
<p><strong>Fight with Warhorse:</strong> If you direct your war-trained mount to attack in battle, you can still make your own attack or attacks normally. This usage is a free action.</p>
<p><strong>Cover:</strong> You can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can't attack or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail your Ride check, you don't get the cover benefit. This usage does not take an action.</p>
<p><strong>Soft Fall:</strong> You can react instantly to try to take no damage when you fall off a mount--when it is killed or when it falls, for example. If you fail your Ride check, you take 1d6 points of falling damage. This usage does not take an action.</p>
<p><strong>Leap:</strong> You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its movement. Use your Ride modifier or the mount's Jump modifier, whichever is lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail your Ride check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an action, but is part of the mount's movement.</p>
<p><strong>Spur Mount:</strong> You can spur your mount to greater speed with a move action. A successful Ride check increases the mount's speed by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You can use this ability every round, but each consecutive round of additional speed deals twice as much damage to the mount as the previous round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).</p>
<p><strong>Control Mount in Battle:</strong> As a move action, you can attempt to control a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not trained for combat riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check, you can do nothing else in that round. You do not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Mount or Dismount:</strong> You can attempt to mount or dismount from a mount of up to one size category larger than yourself as a free action, provided that you still have a move action available that round. If you fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a move action. You can't use fast mount or dismount on a mount more than one size category larger than yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Mounting or dismounting normally is a move action. Other checks are a move action, a free action, or no action at all, as noted above.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you are riding bareback, you take a -5 penalty on Ride checks.</p>
<p>If your mount has a military saddle you get a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle.</p>
<p>The Ride skill is a prerequisite for the feats Mounted Archery, Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge, Trample.</p>
<p>If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="search-int"><a class="header" href="#search-int">Search (Int)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You generally must be within 10 feet of the object or surface to be searched. The table below gives DCs for typical tasks involving the Search skill.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Task</th><th align="center">Search DC</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Ransack a chest full of junk to find a certain item</td><td align="center">10</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Notice a typical secret door or a simple trap</td><td align="center">20</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Find a difficult nonmagical trap (rogue only)1</td><td align="center">21 or higher</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Find a magic trap (rogue only)1</td><td align="center">25 + level of spell used to create trap</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Notice a well-hidden secret door</td><td align="center">30</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Find a footprint</td><td align="center">Varies2</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Dwarves (even if they are not rogues) can use Search to find traps built into or out of stone.</li>
<li>A successful Search check can find a footprint or similar sign of a creature's passage, but it won't let you find or follow a trail. See the Track feat for the appropriate DC.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> It takes a full-round action to search a 5-foot-by-5-foot area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Search checks, and a half-elf has a +1 racial bonus. An elf (but not a half-elf) who simply passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door can make a Search check to find that door.</p>
<p>If you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Search checks.</p>
<p>The spells explosive runes, fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol, and teleportation circle create magic traps that a rogue can find by making a successful Search check and then can attempt to disarm by using Disable Device. Identifying the location of a snare spell has a DC of 23. Spike growth and spike stones create magic traps that can be found using Search, but against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.</p>
<p>Active abjuration spells within 10 feet of each other for 24 hours or more create barely visible energy fluctuations. These fluctuations give you a +4 bonus on Search checks to locate such abjuration spells.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find or follow tracks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), you get a +2 bonus on Search checks to find secret doors or hidden compartments.</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> While anyone can use Search to find a trap whose DC is 20 or lower, only a rogue can use Search to locate traps with higher DCs. (Exception: The spell find traps temporarily enables a cleric to use the Search skill as if he were a rogue.)</p>
<p>A dwarf, even one who is not a rogue, can use the Search skill to find a difficult trap (one with a DC higher than 20) if the trap is built into or out of stone. He gains a +2 racial bonus on the Search check from his stonecunning ability.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sense-motive-wis"><a class="header" href="#sense-motive-wis">Sense Motive (Wis)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> A successful check lets you avoid being bluffed (see the Bluff skill). You can also use this skill to determine when &quot;something is up&quot; (that is, something odd is going on) or to assess someone's trustworthiness. </p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Task</th><th align="center">Sense Motive DC</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Hunch</td><td align="center">20</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sense enchantment</td><td align="center">25 or 15</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Discern secret message</td><td align="center">Varies</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Hunch:</strong> This use of the skill involves making a gut assessment of the social situation. You can get the feeling from another's behavior that something is wrong, such as when you're talking to an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy.</p>
<p><strong>Sense Enchantment:</strong> You can tell that someone's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition, a mind-affecting effect), even if that person isn't aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see dominate person), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target's activities.</p>
<p><strong>Discern Secret Message:</strong> You may use Sense Motive to detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill. In this case, your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of the character transmitting the message. For each piece of information relating to the message that you are missing, you take a -2 penalty on your Sense Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that something hidden is being communicated, but you can't learn anything specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you don't detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you infer some false information.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Trying to gain information with Sense Motive generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening trying to get a sense of the people around you.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> No, though you may make a Sense Motive check for each Bluff check made against you.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A ranger gains a bonus on Sense Motive checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>
<p>If you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sleight-of-hand-dex-trained-only-armor-check-penalty"><a class="header" href="#sleight-of-hand-dex-trained-only-armor-check-penalty">Sleight Of Hand (Dex; Trained Only; Armor Check Penalty)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is determined to note where the item went.</p>
<p>When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer's Spot check. The observer's success doesn't prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.</p>
<p>You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone observing you or the Search check of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus on the Search check, since it's generally easier to find such an object than to hide it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light weapons, and grants you a +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it, and heavy or baggy clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.</p>
<p>Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to obtain it. The opponent makes a Spot check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand check result you achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether you got the item.</p>
<p>You can also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as though you were using the Perform skill. In such a case, your &quot;act&quot; encompasses elements of legerdemain, juggling, and the like.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Sleight of Hand DC</th><th align="left">Task</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">10</td><td align="left">Palm a coin-sized object, make a coin disappear</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">Lift a small object from a person</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Any Sleight of Hand check normally is a standard action. However, you may perform a Sleight of Hand check as a free action by taking a -20 penalty on the check.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, but after an initial failure, a second Sleight of Hand attempt against the same target (or while you are being watched by the same observer who noticed your previous attempt) increases the DC for the task by 10.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> An untrained Sleight of Hand check is simply a Dexterity check. Without actual training, you can't succeed on any Sleight of Hand check with a DC higher than 10, except for hiding an object on your body.</p>

<p>The Speak Language skill doesn't work like other skills. Languages work as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>You start at 1st level knowing one or two languages (based on your race), plus an additional number of languages equal to your starting Intelligence bonus.</li>
<li>You can purchase Speak Language just like any other skill, but instead of buying a rank in it, you choose a new language that you can speak.</li>
<li>You don't make Speak Language checks. You either know a language or you don't.</li>
<li>A literate character (anyone but a barbarian who has not spent skill points to become literate) can read and write any language she speaks. Each language has an alphabet, though sometimes several spoken languages share a single alphabet.</li>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can identify spells and magic effects. The DCs for Spellcraft checks relating to various tasks are summarized on the table above.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies, as noted above.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> See above.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you are a specialist wizard, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks when dealing with a spell or effect from your specialty school. You take a -5 penalty when dealing with a spell or effect from a prohibited school (and some tasks, such as learning a prohibited spell, are just impossible).</p>
<p>If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana), you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to decipher spells on scrolls.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain spells allow you to gain information about magic, provided that you make a successful Spellcraft check as detailed in the spell description.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="spot-wis"><a class="header" href="#spot-wis">Spot (Wis)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> The Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot check is opposed by the Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn't intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary to notice it.</p>
<p>A Spot check result higher than 20 generally lets you become aware of an invisible creature near you, though you can't actually see it.</p>
<p>Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the Disguise skill), and to read lips when you can't hear or understand what someone is saying.</p>
<p>Spot checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter begins. A penalty applies on such checks, depending on the distance between the two individuals or groups, and an additional penalty may apply if the character making the Spot check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Condition</th><th align="center">Penalty</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Per 10 feet of distance</td><td align="center">-1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Spotter distracted</td><td align="center">-5</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Read Lips:</strong> To understand what someone is saying by reading lips, you must be within 30 feet of the speaker, be able to see him or her speak, and understand the speaker's language. (This use of the skill is language-dependent.) The base DC is 15, but it increases for complex speech or an inarticulate speaker. You must maintain a line of sight to the lips being read.</p>
<p>If your Spot check succeeds, you can understand the general content of a minute's worth of speaking, but you usually still miss certain details. If the check fails by 4 or less, you can't read the speaker's lips. If the check fails by 5 or more, you draw some incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is rolled secretly in this case, so that you don't know whether you succeeded or missed by 5.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Every time you have a chance to spot something in a reactive manner you can make a Spot check without using an action. Trying to spot something you failed to see previously is a move action. To read lips, you must concentrate for a full minute before making a Spot check, and you can't perform any other action (other than moving at up to half speed) during this minute.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. You can try to spot something that you failed to see previously at no penalty. You can attempt to read lips once per minute.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fascinated creature takes a -4 penalty on Spot checks made as reactions.</p>
<p>If you have the Alertness feat, you get a +2 bonus on Spot checks.</p>
<p>A ranger gains a bonus on Spot checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>
<p>An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
<p>A half-elf has a +1 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
<p>The master of a hawk familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in daylight or other lighted areas.</p>
<p>The master of an owl familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in shadowy or other darkened areas.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="survival-wis"><a class="header" href="#survival-wis">Survival (Wis)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild. The table below gives the DCs for various tasks that require Survival checks.</p>
<p>Survival does not allow you to follow difficult tracks unless you are a ranger or have the Track feat (see the Restriction section below).</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="center">Survival DC</th><th align="left">Task</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="center">10</td><td align="left">Get along in the wild. Move up to one-half your overland speed while hunting and foraging (no food or water supplies needed). You can provide food and water for one other person for every 2 points by which your check result exceeds 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">15</td><td align="left">Gain a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves against severe weather while moving up to one-half your overland speed, or gain a +4 bonus if you remain stationary. You may grant the same bonus to one other character for every 1 point by which your Survival check result exceeds 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">15</td><td align="left">Keep from getting lost or avoid natural hazards, such as quicksand.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">15</td><td align="left">Predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. For every 5 points by which your Survival check result exceeds 15, you can predict the weather for one additional day in advance.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Varies</td><td align="left">Follow tracks (see the Track feat).</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. A single Survival check may represent activity over the course of hours or a full day. A Survival check made to find tracks is at least a full-round action, and it may take even longer.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. For getting along in the wild or for gaining the Fortitude save bonus noted in the table above, you make a Survival check once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies until the next check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural hazards, you make a Survival check whenever the situation calls for one. Retries to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid a specific natural hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes(indoors) of searching.</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> While anyone can use Survival to find tracks (regardless of the DC), or to follow tracks when the DC for the task is 10 or lower, only a ranger (or a character with the Track feat) can use Survival to follow tracks when the task has a higher DC.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you can automatically determine where true north lies in relation to yourself.</p>
<p>A ranger gains a bonus on Survival checks when using this skill to find or follow the tracks of a favored enemy.</p>
<p>If you have the Self-Sufficient feat, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while underground.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks in aboveground natural environments (aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, and plains).</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find or follow tracks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="swim-str-armor-check-penalty"><a class="header" href="#swim-str-armor-check-penalty">Swim (Str; Armor Check Penalty)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to one-half your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-quarter your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.</p>
<p>If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check, you begin to drown.</p>
<p>The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table below.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Water</th><th>Swim DC</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Calm water</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Rough water</td><td>15</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Stormy water</td><td>20<sup>1</sup></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>You can't take 10 on a Swim check in stormy water, even if you aren't otherwise being threatened or distracted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> A successful Swim check allows you to swim one-quarter of your speed as a move action or one-half your speed as a full-round action.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Swim checks are subject to double the normal armor check penalty and encumbrance penalty.</p>
<p>If you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Swim checks.</p>
<p>If you have the Endurance feat, you get a +4 bonus on Swim checks made to avoid taking nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>
<p>A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its indicated speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The creature always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered when swimming. Such a creature can use the run action while swimming, provided that it swims in a straight line.</p>

<p>You can't use this skill if your speed has been reduced by armor, excess equipment, or loot.</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can land softly when you fall or tumble past opponents. You can also tumble to entertain an audience (as though using the Perform skill). The DCs for various tasks involving the Tumble skill are given on the table below.</p>

Each additional enemy after the first adds +2 to the Tumble DC.</td></tr>

<li>Tumbling is impossible in a deep bog.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Accelerated Tumbling:</strong> You try to tumble past or through enemies more quickly than normal. By accepting a -10 penalty on your Tumble checks, you can move at your full speed instead of one-half your speed.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Not applicable. Tumbling is part of movement, so a Tumble check is part of a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Usually no. An audience, once it has judged a tumbler as an uninteresting performer, is not receptive to repeat performances.</p>
<p>You can try to reduce damage from a fall as an instant reaction only once per fall.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2 dodge bonus to AC.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +6 dodge bonus to AC when executing the total defense standard action instead of the usual +4 dodge bonus to AC.</p>

<p>Use this skill to activate magic</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you were a different race, or as if you were of a different alignment.</p>
<p>You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand. If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.</p>
<p>You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for that purpose. The DCs for various tasks involving Use Magic Device checks are summarized on the table below.</p>

<p><strong>Activate Blindly:</strong> Some magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you're not and even if you don't know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you've activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can't activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but it doesn't do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Decipher a Written Spell:</strong> This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Emulate an Ability Score:</strong> To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you're emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don't need to make this check.</p>
<p><strong>Emulate an Alignment:</strong> Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user's alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Emulate a Class Feature:</strong> Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20.  This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).</p>
<p><strong>Emulate a Race:</strong> Some magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Use a Scroll:</strong> If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll's spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don't have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).</p>
<p>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items.</p>
<p><strong>Use a Wand:</strong> Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand's spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill also applies to other spell trigger magic items, such as staffs.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can't try to activate that item again for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You cannot take 10 with this skill.</p>
<p>You can't aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the item may attempt such a check.</p>
<p>If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus to Spellcraft checks made to decipher spells on scrolls.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="use-rope-dex"><a class="header" href="#use-rope-dex">Use Rope (Dex)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Most tasks with a rope are relatively simple. The DCs for various tasks utilizing this skill are summarized on the table below.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Use Rope DC</th><th>Task</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">10</td><td>Tie a firm knot</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">10<sup>1</sup></td><td>Secure a grappling hook</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">15</td><td>Tie a special knot, such as one that slips, slides slowly, or loosens with a tug</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">15</td><td>Tie a rope around yourself one-handed</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">15</td><td>Splice two ropes together</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Varies</td><td>Bind a character</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Add 2 to the DC for every 10 feet the hook is thrown; see below.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Secure a Grappling Hook:</strong> Securing a grappling hook requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet of distance the grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting weight. This check is made secretly, so that you don't know whether the rope will hold your weight.</p>
<p><strong>Bind a Character:</strong> When you bind another character with a rope, any Escape Artist check that the bound character makes is opposed by your Use Rope check.</p>
<p>You get a +10 bonus on this check because it is easier to bind someone than to escape from bonds. You don't even make your Use Rope check until someone tries to escape.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Tying a knot, tying a special knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two ropes together takes 5 minutes. Binding a character takes 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A silk rope gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Rope checks. If you cast an animate rope spell on a rope, you get a +2 circumstance bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using that rope.</p>
<p>These bonuses stack.</p>
<p>If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks when escaping from rope bonds.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2 bonus on checks made to bind someone.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="feats"><a class="header" href="#feats">Feats</a></h1>
<h2 id="prerequisites"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill, base attack bonus, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.</p>
<p>A character can't use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-feats"><a class="header" href="#types-of-feats">Types Of Feats</a></h2>
<p>Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are item creation feats, which allow spellcasters to create magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and cast a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell were a higher spell level than it actually is.</p>
<h3 id="fighter-bonus-feats"><a class="header" href="#fighter-bonus-feats">Fighter Bonus Feats</a></h3>
<p>Any feat designated as a fighter feat can be selected as a fighter's bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming that they meet any prerequisites.</p>
<h3 id="item-creation-feats"><a class="header" href="#item-creation-feats">Item Creation Feats</a></h3>
<p>An item creation feat lets a spellcaster create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.</p>
<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> Experience that the spellcaster would normally keep is expended when making a magic item. The XP cost equals 1/25 of the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.</p>
<p><strong>Raw Materials Cost:</strong> The cost of creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the item.</p>
<p>Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.</p>
<p><strong>Item Cost:</strong> Brew Potion, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of these items depends on their caster level--that is, a spell from such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price of these items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be high enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scrolls:</strong> Base price = spell level x caster level x 25 gp.</li>
<li><strong>Potions:</strong> Base price = spell level x caster level x 50 gp.</li>
<li><strong>Wands:</strong> Base price = spell level x caster level x 750 gp.</li>
</ul>
<p>A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Costs:</strong> Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component or pay the XP cost when creating the item.</p>
<p>For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.</p>
<p>Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
<h3 id="metamagic-feats"><a class="header" href="#metamagic-feats">Metamagic Feats</a></h3>
<p>As a spellcaster's knowledge of magic grows, she can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the ways in which the spells were originally designed or learned. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, at least it is possible.  Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it does not go up.</p>
<p>Wizards and Divine Spellcasters: Wizards and divine spellcasters must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation, the character chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and thus which ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).</p>
<p>Sorcerers and Bards: Sorcerers and bards choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. But because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell's normal casting time is 1 action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn't the same as a 1-round casting time.)</p>
<p>For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.</p>
<p>Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats: A cleric spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell can cast a metamagic version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a 1-action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast.</p>
<p>Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell: In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared and cast as a higher-level spell. Saving throw modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description.</p>
<p>The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can't use a metamagic feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.</p>
<p>Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don't eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened. However, casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can't modify.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell:</strong> A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can't apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Items and Metamagic Spells:</strong> With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell's higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn't need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.</p>
<p><strong>Counterspelling Metamagic Spells:</strong> Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell.</p>

<h3 id="blind-fight-general"><a class="header" href="#blind-fight-general">Blind-Fight [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> In melee, every time you miss because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit.</p>
<p>An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however.</p>
<p>You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general reduces your speed to three-quarters normal, instead of one-half.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility also applies.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> The Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a blink spell.</p>
<p>A fighter may select Blind-Fight as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="brew-potion-item-creation"><a class="header" href="#brew-potion-item-creation">Brew Potion [Item Creation]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Caster level 3rd.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Brewing a potion takes one day. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its spell level x ?its caster level x ?50 gp. To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price.</p>
<p>When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.</p>
<p>Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the potion.</p>
<h3 id="cleave-general"><a class="header" href="#cleave-general">Cleave [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Str 13, Power Attack.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> If you deal a creature enough damage to make it drop (typically by dropping it to below 0 hit points or killing it), you get an immediate, extra melee attack against another creature within reach. You cannot take a 5-foot step before making this extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the same bonus as the attack that dropped the previous creature. You can use this ability once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Cleave as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="combat-casting-general"><a class="header" href="#combat-casting-general">Combat Casting [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while on the defensive or while you are grappling or pinned.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Character level 6th.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Having this feat enables the character to attract loyal companions and devoted followers, subordinates who assist her. See the table below for what sort of cohort and how many followers the character can recruit.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Modifiers:</strong> Several factors can affect a character's Leadership score, causing it to vary from the base score (character level + Cha modifier). A character's reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower he is trying to attract) raises or lowers his Leadership score:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Leader's Reputation</th><th align="center">Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Great renown</td><td align="center">+2</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Fairness and generosity</td><td align="center">+1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Special power</td><td align="center">+1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Failure</td><td align="center">-1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Aloofness</td><td align="center">-1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Cruelty</td><td align="center">-2</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Other modifiers may apply when the character tries to attract a cohort:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">The Leader...</th><th align="center">Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Has a familiar, special mount, or animal companion</td><td align="center">-2</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Recruits a cohort of a different alignment</td><td align="center">-1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Caused the death of a cohort</td><td align="center">-2<sup>*</sup></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>* Cumulative per cohort killed.</p>
<p>Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When the character tries to attract a new follower, use any of the following modifiers that apply.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">The Leader...</th><th>Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Has a stronghold, base of operations, guildhouse, or the like</td><td>+2</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Moves around a lot</td><td>-1</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Leadership Score:</strong> A character's base Leadership score equals his level plus any Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but the character must still be 6th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect a character's Leadership score, as detailed above.</p>
<p><strong>Cohort Level:</strong> The character can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of a character's Leadership score, he can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than himself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and alignment. The cohort's alignment may not be opposed to the leader's alignment on either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis, and the leader takes a Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of an alignment different from his own.</p>
<p>Cohorts earn XP as follows:</p>
<p>The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party's XP.</p>
<p>Divide the cohort's level by the level of the PC with whom he or she is associated (the character with the Leadership feat who attracted the cohort).</p>
<p>Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the cohort's total.</p>
<p>If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than the associated PC's character level, the cohort does not gain the new level--its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next level. </p>
<p><strong>Number of Followers by Level:</strong> The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they're generally low-level NPCs. Because they're generally five or more levels behind the character they follow, they're rarely effective in combat.</p>
<p>Followers don't earn experience and thus don't gain levels. However, when a character with Leadership attains a new level, the player consults the table above to determine if she has acquired more followers, some of which may be higher level than the existing followers. (You don't consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.)</p>
<h3 id="lightning-reflexes-general"><a class="header" href="#lightning-reflexes-general">Lightning Reflexes [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving throws.</p>
<h3 id="magical-aptitude-general"><a class="header" href="#magical-aptitude-general">Magical Aptitude [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Spellcraft checks and Use Magic Device checks.</p>
<h3 id="manyshot-general"><a class="header" href="#manyshot-general">Manyshot [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 17, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a standard action, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet. Both arrows use the same attack roll (with a -4 penalty) to determine success and deal damage normally (but see Special).</p>
<p>For every five points of base attack bonus you have above +6, you may add one additional arrow to this attack, to a maximum of four arrows at a base attack bonus of +16. However, each arrow after the second adds a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll (for a total penalty of -6 for three arrows and -8 for four).</p>
<p>Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Regardless of the number of arrows you fire, you apply precision-based damage only once. If you score a critical hit, only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal regular damage.</p>
<p>A fighter may select Manyshot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<p>A 6th-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Manyshot even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.</p>
<h3 id="martial-weapon-proficiency-general"><a class="header" href="#martial-weapon-proficiency-general">Martial Weapon Proficiency [General]</a></h3>
<p>Choose a type of martial weapon. You understand how to use that type of martial weapon in combat.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You make attack rolls with the selected weapon normally.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all martial weapons. They need not select this feat.</p>
<p>You can gain Martial Weapon Proficiency multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon. </p>
<p>A cleric who chooses the War domain automatically gains the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat related to his deity's favored weapon as a bonus feat, if the weapon is a martial one. He need not select it.</p>
<h3 id="maximize-spell-metamagic"><a class="header" href="#maximize-spell-metamagic">Maximize Spell [Metamagic]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.</p>
<p>An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result.</p>
<h3 id="mobility-general"><a class="header" href="#mobility-general">Mobility [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, Dodge.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a threatened area. A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.</p>
<p>Dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Mobility as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="mounted-archery-general"><a class="header" href="#mounted-archery-general">Mounted Archery [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The penalty you take when using a ranged weapon while mounted is halved: -2 instead of -4 if your mount is taking a double move, and -4 instead of -8 if your mount is running.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Mounted Archery as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="mounted-combat-general"><a class="header" href="#mounted-combat-general">Mounted Combat [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Ride 1 rank.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as a reaction) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent's attack roll. (Essentially, the Ride check result becomes the mount's Armor Class if it's higher than the mount's regular AC.)</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Mounted Combat as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="natural-spell-general"><a class="header" href="#natural-spell-general">Natural Spell [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wis 13, wild shape ability.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can complete the verbal and somatic components of spells while in a wild shape. You substitute various noises and gestures for the normal verbal and somatic components of a spell.</p>
<p>You can also use any material components or focuses you possess, even if such items are melded within your current form. This feat does not permit the use of magic items while you are in a form that could not ordinarily use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak while in a wild shape.</p>
<h3 id="negotiator-general"><a class="header" href="#negotiator-general">Negotiator [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy checks and Sense Motive checks.</p>
<h3 id="nimble-fingers-general"><a class="header" href="#nimble-fingers-general">Nimble Fingers [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Disable Device checks and Open Lock checks.</p>
<h3 id="persuasive-general"><a class="header" href="#persuasive-general">Persuasive [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Bluff checks and Intimidate checks.</p>
<h3 id="point-blank-shot-general"><a class="header" href="#point-blank-shot-general">Point Blank Shot [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Point Blank Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="power-attack-general"><a class="header" href="#power-attack-general">Power Attack [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Str 13.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> On your action, before making attack rolls for a round, you may choose to subtract a number from all melee attack rolls and add the same number to all melee damage rolls. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage apply until your next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands, instead add twice the number subtracted from your attack rolls. You can't add the bonus from Power Attack to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with unarmed strikes or natural weapon attacks), even though the penalty on attack rolls still applies. (Normally, you treat a double weapon as a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a double weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of it in a round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.)</p>
<p>A fighter may select Power Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="precise-shot-general"><a class="header" href="#precise-shot-general">Precise Shot [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Point Blank Shot.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard -4 penalty on your attack roll.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Precise Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="quick-draw-general"><a class="header" href="#quick-draw-general">Quick Draw [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Base attack bonus +1.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You can draw a hidden weapon (see the Sleight of Hand skill) as a move action.</p>
<p>A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow).</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Quick Draw as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="quicken-spell-metamagic"><a class="header" href="#quicken-spell-metamagic">Quicken Spell [Metamagic]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Casting a quickened spell is a free action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. You may cast only one quickened spell per round. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 full round action cannot be quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat can't be applied to any spell cast spontaneously (including sorcerer spells, bard spells, and cleric or druid spells cast spontaneously), since applying a metamagic feat to a spontaneously cast spell automatically increases the casting time to a full-round action.</p>
<h3 id="rapid-reload-general"><a class="header" href="#rapid-reload-general">Rapid Reload [General]</a></h3>
<p>Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy).</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow. </p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.</p>
<p>A fighter may select Rapid Reload as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="rapid-shot-general"><a class="header" href="#rapid-shot-general">Rapid Shot [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, Point Blank Shot.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can get one extra attack per round with a ranged weapon. The attack is at your highest base attack bonus, but each attack you make in that round (the extra one and the normal ones) takes a -2 penalty. You must use the full attack action to use this feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Rapid Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<p>A 2nd-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Rapid Shot, even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.</p>
<h3 id="ride-by-attack-general"><a class="header" href="#ride-by-attack-general">Ride-By Attack [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may move and attack as if with a standard charge and then move again (continuing the straight line of the charge). Your total movement for the round can't exceed double your mounted speed. You and your mount do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the opponent that you attack.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Ride-By Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="run-general"><a class="header" href="#run-general">Run [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When running, you move five times your normal speed (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If you make a jump after a running start (see the Jump skill description), you gain a +4 bonus on your Jump check. While running, you retain your Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> You move four times your speed while running (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or three times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load), and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
<h3 id="scribe-scroll-item-creation"><a class="header" href="#scribe-scroll-item-creation">Scribe Scroll [Item Creation]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Caster level 1st.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can create a scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a scroll is its spell level x ?its caster level x ?25 gp. To scribe a scroll, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.</p>
<p>Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when scribing the scroll.</p>
<h3 id="self-sufficient-general"><a class="header" href="#self-sufficient-general">Self-Sufficient [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Heal checks and Survival checks.</p>
<h3 id="shield-proficiency-general"><a class="header" href="#shield-proficiency-general">Shield Proficiency [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can use a shield and take only the standard penalties.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> When you are using a shield with which you are not proficient, you take the shield's armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all skill checks that involve moving, including Ride checks.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Barbarians, bards, clerics, druids, fighters, paladins, and rangers automatically have Shield Proficiency as a bonus feat. They need not select it.</p>
<h3 id="shot-on-the-run-general"><a class="header" href="#shot-on-the-run-general">Shot On The Run [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, base attack bonus +4.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using the attack action with a ranged weapon, you can move both before and after the attack, provided that your total distance moved is not greater than your speed.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Shot on the Run as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="silent-spell-metamagic"><a class="header" href="#silent-spell-metamagic">Silent Spell [Metamagic]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> A silent spell can be cast with no verbal components. Spells without verbal components are not affected. A silent spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Bard spells cannot be enhanced by this metamagic feat.</p>
<h3 id="simple-weapon-proficiency-general"><a class="header" href="#simple-weapon-proficiency-general">Simple Weapon Proficiency [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You make attack rolls with simple weapons normally.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> All characters except for druids, monks, and wizards are automatically proficient with all simple weapons. They need not select this feat.</p>
<h3 id="skill-focus-general"><a class="header" href="#skill-focus-general">Skill Focus [General]</a></h3>
<p>Choose a skill.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving that skill.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new skill.</p>
<h3 id="snatch-arrows-general"><a class="header" href="#snatch-arrows-general">Snatch Arrows [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 15, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using the Deflect Arrows feat you may catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it. Thrown weapons can immediately be thrown back at the original attacker (even though it isn't your turn) or kept for later use.</p>
<p>You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Snatch Arrows as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="spell-focus-general"><a class="header" href="#spell-focus-general">Spell Focus [General]</a></h3>
<p>Choose a school of magic.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against spells from the school of magic you select.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school of magic.</p>
<h3 id="spell-mastery-special"><a class="header" href="#spell-mastery-special">Spell Mastery [Special]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Wizard level 1st.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Each time you take this feat, choose a number of spells equal to your Intelligence modifier that you already know. From that point on, you can prepare these spells without referring to a spellbook.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, you must use a spellbook to prepare all your spells, except read magic.</p>
<h3 id="spell-penetration-general"><a class="header" href="#spell-penetration-general">Spell Penetration [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on caster level checks (1d20 + caster level) made to overcome a creature's spell resistance.</p>
<h3 id="spirited-charge-general"><a class="header" href="#spirited-charge-general">Spirited Charge [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When mounted and using the charge action, you deal double damage with a melee weapon (or triple damage with a lance).</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Spirited Charge as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="spring-attack-general"><a class="header" href="#spring-attack-general">Spring Attack [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility, base attack bonus +4.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using the attack action with a melee weapon, you can move both before and after the attack, provided that your total distance moved is not greater than your speed. Moving in this way does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender you attack, though it might provoke attacks of opportunity from other creatures, if appropriate. You can't use this feat if you are wearing heavy armor.</p>
<p>You must move at least 5 feet both before and after you make your attack in order to utilize the benefits of Spring Attack.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Spring Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="stealthy-general"><a class="header" href="#stealthy-general">Stealthy [General]</a></h3>

<p>Spells without somatic components are not affected. A stilled spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.</p>
<h3 id="stunning-fist-general"><a class="header" href="#stunning-fist-general">Stunning Fist [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your next action). A stunned character can't act, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a -2 penalty to AC. You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be stunned.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A monk may select Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. A monk who selects this feat may attempt a stunning attack a number of times per day equal to her monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels she has in classes other than monk.</p>
<p>A fighter may select Stunning Fist as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="toughness-general"><a class="header" href="#toughness-general">Toughness [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain +3 hit points.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A character may gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.</p>
<h3 id="tower-shield-proficiency-general"><a class="header" href="#tower-shield-proficiency-general">Tower Shield Proficiency [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Shield Proficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can use a tower shield and suffer only the standard penalties.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> A character who is using a shield with which he or she is not proficient takes the shield's armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all skill checks that involve moving, including Ride.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Fighters automatically have Tower Shield Proficiency as a bonus feat. They need not select it.</p>
<h3 id="track-general"><a class="header" href="#track-general">Track [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow.</p>
<p>You move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed with a -5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed with a -20 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions, as given on the table below:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Surface</th><th align="center">Survival DC</th><th align="left">Surface Survival</th><th align="center">DC</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Very soft ground</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="left">Firm ground</td><td align="center">15</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Soft ground</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="left">Hard ground</td><td align="center">20</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Very Soft Ground:</strong> Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints.</p>
<p><strong>Soft Ground:</strong> Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints.</p>
<p><strong>Firm Ground:</strong> Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.</p>
<p><strong>Hard Ground:</strong> Any surface that doesn't hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles). </p>
<p>Several modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the table below.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Condition</th><th align="center">Survival DC Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Every three creatures in the group being tracked</td><td align="center">-1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Size of creature or creatures being tracked:<sup>1</sup></td><td align="center"></td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>For a group of mixed sizes, apply only the modifier for the largest size category.</li>
<li>Apply only the largest modifier from this category.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you fail a Survival check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, you can use the Survival skill to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, you can use the Search skill to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature's passage using the DCs given above, but you can't use Search to follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A ranger automatically has Track as a bonus feat. He need not select it.</p>
<p>This feat does not allow you to find or follow the tracks made by a subject of a pass without trace spell.</p>
<h3 id="trample-general"><a class="header" href="#trample-general">Trample [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you attempt to overrun an opponent while mounted, your target may not choose to avoid you. Your mount may make one hoof attack against any target you knock down, gaining the standard +4 bonus on attack rolls against prone targets.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Trample as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="two-weapon-defense-general"><a class="header" href="#two-weapon-defense-general">Two-Weapon Defense [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 15, Two-Weapon Fighting.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When wielding a double weapon or two weapons (not including natural weapons or unarmed strikes), you gain a +1 shield bonus to your AC.</p>
<p>When you are fighting defensively or using the total defense action, this shield bonus increases to +2.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Two-Weapon Defense as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="two-weapon-fighting-general"><a class="header" href="#two-weapon-fighting-general">Two-Weapon Fighting [General]</a></h3>
<p>You can fight with a weapon in each hand. You can make one extra attack each round with the second weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Dex 15.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting with two weapons are reduced. The penalty for your primary hand lessens by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens by 6.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. When fighting in this way you suffer a -6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a -10 penalty to the attack with your off hand. If your off-hand weapon is light the penalties are reduced by 2 each. (An unarmed strike is always considered light.)</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A 2nd-level ranger who has chosen the two-weapon combat style is treated as having Two-Weapon Fighting, even if he does not have the prerequisite for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.</p>
<p>A fighter may select Two-Weapon Fighting as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

<p>Natural weapons are always considered light weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, Int 13, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, base attack bonus +4.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you use the full attack action, you can give up your regular attacks and instead make one melee attack at your full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach.</p>
