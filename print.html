<p>This is the System Reference Document v3.5,
converted from the original RTF files into Markdown.
The bulk of the conversion work was done programmatically.
After that, fixes were applied by hand.</p>
<p>While the content is organized into more pages than the base RTF files,
there are not any <em>intentional</em> rules differences between this markdown version and the official RTF version.
However, typos and errors are always possible.</p>
<p>If you notice any problems please <a href="https://github.com/Lokathor/srd35-md/issues">file an issue</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-basics"><a class="header" href="#the-basics">The Basics</a></h1>
<p><strong>The Core Mechanic:</strong> Whenever you attempt an action that has some chance of failure, you roll a twenty-sided die (d20). To determine if your character succeeds at a task you do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll a d20.</li>
<li>Add any relevant modifiers.</li>
<li>Compare the result to a target number.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the result equals or exceeds the target number, your character succeeds. If the result is lower than the target number, you fail.</p>
<h2 id="dice"><a class="header" href="#dice">Dice</a></h2>
<p>Dice rolls are described with expressions such as &quot;3d4+3,&quot; which means &quot;roll three four-sided dice and add 3&quot; (resulting in a number between 6 and 15). The first number tells you how many dice to roll (adding the results together). The number immediately after the &quot;d&quot; tells you the type of die to use. Any number after that indicates a quantity that is added or subtracted from the result.</p>
<p><strong>d%:</strong> Percentile dice work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before you roll) is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100.</p>
<h2 id="rounding-fractions"><a class="header" href="#rounding-fractions">Rounding Fractions</a></h2>
<p>In general, if you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the fraction is one-half or larger.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Certain rolls, such as damage and hit points, have a minimum of 1.</p>
<h2 id="multiplying"><a class="header" href="#multiplying">Multiplying</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes a rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll. As long as you're applying a single multiplier, multiply the number normally. When two or more multipliers apply to any abstract value (such as a modifier or a die roll), however, combine them into a single multiple, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. Thus, a double (x2) and a double (x2) applied to the same number results in a triple (x3, because 2 + 1 = 3).</p>
<p>When applying multipliers to real-world values (such as weight or distance), normal rules of math apply instead. A creature whose size doubles (thus multiplying its weight by 8) and then is turned to stone (which would multiply its weight by a factor of roughly 3) now weighs about 24 times normal, not 10 times normal. Similarly, a blinded creature attempting to negotiate difficult terrain would count each square as 4 squares (doubling the cost twice, for a total multiplier of x4), rather than as 3 squares (adding 100% twice). </p>
<h2 id="ability-scores"><a class="header" href="#ability-scores">Ability Scores</a></h2>
<h3 id="ability-modifiers"><a class="header" href="#ability-modifiers">Ability Modifiers</a></h3>
<p>Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging from -5 to +5. Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells shows the modifier for each score. It also shows bonus spells, which you'll need to know about if your character is a spellcaster.</p>
<p>The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren't die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty.</p>
<h4 id="table-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells"><a class="header" href="#table-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a></h4>
<p>Bonus Spell slots are listed by spell level.</p>
<p>A character never gains bonus 0th level slots.</p>
<p>If a character's ability score is 9 or less they cannot cast spells associated with that ability.</p>

<h3 id="abilities-and-spellcasters"><a class="header" href="#abilities-and-spellcasters">Abilities And Spellcasters</a></h3>
<p>The ability that governs bonus spells depends on what type of spellcaster your character is: Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers; or Charisma for sorcerers and bards. In addition to having a high ability score, a spellcaster must be of high enough class level to be able to cast spells of a given spell level. (See the class descriptions for details.)</p>
<h3 id="the-abilities"><a class="header" href="#the-abilities">The Abilities</a></h3>
<p>Each ability partially describes your character and affects some of his or her actions.</p>
<h4 id="strength-str"><a class="header" href="#strength-str">Strength (Str)</a></h4>
<p>Strength measures your character's muscle and physical power. This ability is especially important for fighters, barbarians, paladins, rangers, and monks because it helps them prevail in combat. Strength also limits the amount of equipment your character can carry.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Strength modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Melee attack rolls.</li>
<li>Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon (including a sling). (Exceptions: Off-hand attacks receive only one-half the character's Strength bonus, while two-handed attacks receive one and a half times the Strength bonus. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies to attacks made with a bow that is not a composite bow.)</li>
<li>Climb, Jump, and Swim checks. These are the skills that have Strength as their key ability.</li>
<li>Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dexterity-dex"><a class="header" href="#dexterity-dex">Dexterity (Dex)</a></h4>
<p>Dexterity measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is the most important one for rogues, but it's also high on the list for characters who typically wear light or medium armor (rangers and barbarians) or no armor at all (monks, wizards, and sorcerers), and for anyone who wants to be a skilled archer.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ranged attack rolls, including those for attacks made with bows, crossbows, throwing axes, and other ranged weapons.</li>
<li>Armor Class (AC), provided that the character can react to the attack.</li>
<li>Reflex saving throws, for avoiding fireballs and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly.</li>
<li>Balance, Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, Ride, Sleight of Hand, Tumble, and Use Rope checks. These are the skills that have Dexterity as their key ability.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="constitution-con"><a class="header" href="#constitution-con">Constitution (Con)</a></h4>
<p>Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, so the ability is important for all classes.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Constitution modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each roll of a Hit Die (though a penalty can never drop a result below 1--that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit point each time he or she advances in level).</li>
<li>Fortitude saving throws, for resisting poison and similar threats.</li>
<li>Concentration checks. Concentration is a skill, important to spellcasters, that has Constitution as its key ability.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a character's Constitution score changes enough to alter his or her Constitution modifier, the character's hit points also increase or decrease accordingly.</p>
<h4 id="intelligence-int"><a class="header" href="#intelligence-int">Intelligence (Int)</a></h4>
<p>Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This ability is important for wizards because it affects how many spells they can cast, how hard their spells are to resist, and how powerful their spells can be. It's also important for any character who wants to have a wide assortment of skills.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of languages your character knows at the start of the game.</li>
<li>The number of skill points gained each level. (But your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.)</li>
<li>Appraise, Craft, Decipher Script, Disable Device, Forgery, Knowledge, Search, and Spellcraft checks. These are the skills that have Intelligence as their key ability.</li>
</ul>
<p>A wizard gains bonus spells based on her Intelligence score. The minimum Intelligence score needed to cast a wizard spell is 10 + the spell's level. </p>
<p>An animal has an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. A creature of humanlike intelligence has a score of at least 3.</p>
<h4 id="wisdom-wis"><a class="header" href="#wisdom-wis">Wisdom (Wis)</a></h4>
<p>Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While Intelligence represents one's ability to analyze information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one's surroundings. Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and druids, and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will saving throws (for negating the effect of charm person and other spells).</li>
<li>Heal, Listen, Profession, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks. These are the skills that have Wisdom as their key ability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers get bonus spells based on their Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a cleric, druid, paladin, or ranger spell is 10 + the spell's level.</p>
<h4 id="charisma-cha"><a class="header" href="#charisma-cha">Charisma (Cha)</a></h4>
<p>Charisma measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social setting. Charisma is most important for paladins, sorcerers, and bards. It is also important for clerics, since it affects their ability to turn undead. Every creature has a Charisma score.</p>
<p>You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Gather Information, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Perform, and Use Magic Device checks. These are the skills that have Charisma as their key ability.</li>
<li>Checks that represent attempts to influence others. </li>
<li>Turning checks for clerics and paladins attempting to turn zombies, vampires, and other undead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorcerers and bards get bonus spells based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma score needed to cast a sorcerer or bard spell is 10 + the spell's level.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-changes"><a class="header" href="#ability-score-changes">Ability Score Changes</a></h3>
<p>When an ability score changes, all attributes associated with that score change accordingly. A character does not retroactively get additional skill points for previous levels if she increases her intelligence.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="races"><a class="header" href="#races">Races</a></h1>
<h2 id="favored-class"><a class="header" href="#favored-class">Favored Class</a></h2>
<p>A character's favored class doesn't count against him or her when determining experience point penalties for multiclassing. </p>
<h2 id="race-and-languages"><a class="header" href="#race-and-languages">Race and Languages</a></h2>
<p>All characters know how to speak Common. A dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, or halfling also speaks a racial language, as appropriate. A character who has an Intelligence bonus at 1st level speaks other languages as well, one extra language per point of Intelligence bonus as a starting character. </p>
<p><strong>Literacy:</strong> Any character except a barbarian can read and write all the languages he or she speaks.</p>
<p><strong>Class-Related Languages:</strong> Clerics, druids, and wizards can choose certain languages as bonus languages even if they're not on the lists found in the race descriptions. These class-related languages are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleric: Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal.</li>
<li>Druid: Sylvan.</li>
<li>Wizard: Draconic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="small-characters"><a class="header" href="#small-characters">Small Characters</a></h2>
<p>A Small character gets a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. A Small character's carrying capacity is three-quarters of that of a Medium character.</p>
<p>A Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as a Medium character.</p>
<p>A Small character must use smaller weapons than a Medium character.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dwarf"><a class="header" href="#dwarf">Dwarf</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>+2 Constitution, -2 Charisma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medium:</strong> As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such situations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Darkvision:</strong> Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves can function just fine with no light at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stonecunning:</strong> This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weapon Familiarity:</strong> Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stability:</strong> A dwarf gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.</p>

</li>

<p>+2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic Languages:</strong> Common and Elven. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, and Sylvan.</p>

<p>+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>+4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type. Any time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when it's caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too.</p>

<h2 id="arcane-spells-and-armor"><a class="header" href="#arcane-spells-and-armor">Arcane Spells And Armor</a></h2>
<p>Wizards and sorcerers do not know how to wear armor effectively.</p>
<p>If desired, they can wear armor anyway (though they'll be clumsy in it), or they can gain training in the proper use of armor (with the various Armor Proficiency feats--light, medium, and heavy--and the Shield Proficiency feat), or they can multiclass to add a class that grants them armor proficiency. Even if a wizard or sorcerer is wearing armor with which he or she is proficient, however, it might still interfere with spellcasting.</p>
<p>Armor restricts the complicated gestures that a wizards or sorcerer must make while casting any spell that has a somatic component (most do). The armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.</p>
<p>By contrast, bards not only know how to wear light armor effectively, but they can also ignore the arcane spell failure chance for such armor. A bard wearing armor heavier than light or using any type of shield incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance, even if he becomes proficient with that armor.</p>
<p>If a spell doesn't have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no problem while wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster's hands are bound or if he or she is grappling (although Concentration checks still apply normally). Also, the metamagic feat Still Spell allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell at one spell level higher than normal without the somatic component. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.</p>
<h2 id="multiclass-characters"><a class="header" href="#multiclass-characters">Multiclass Characters</a></h2>
<p>A character may add new classes as he or she progresses in level, thus becoming a multiclass character. The class abilities from a character's different classes combine to determine a multiclass character's overall abilities. Multiclassing improves a character's versatility at the expense of focus.</p>
<h3 id="class-and-level-features"><a class="header" href="#class-and-level-features">Class And Level Features</a></h3>
<p>As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum of the abilities of each of the character's classes.</p>
<p><strong>Level:</strong> &quot;Character level&quot; is a character's total number of levels. It is used to determine when feats and ability score boosts are gained.</p>
<p>&quot;Class level&quot; is a character's level in a particular class. For a character whose levels are all in the same class, character level and class level are the same.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> A character gains hit points from each class as his or her class level increases, adding the new hit points to the previous total. </p>
<p><strong>Base Attack Bonus:</strong> Add the base attack bonuses acquired for each class to get the character's base attack bonus. A resulting value of +6 or higher provides the character with multiple attacks. </p>
<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Add the base save bonuses for each class together.</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> If a skill is a class skill for any of a multiclass character's classes, then character level determines a skill's maximum rank. (The maximum rank for a class skill is 3 + character level.)</p>
<p>If a skill is not a class skill for any of a multiclass character's classes, the maximum rank for that skill is one-half the maximum for a class skill.</p>
<p><strong>Class Features:</strong> A multiclass character gets all the class features of all his or her classes but must also suffer the consequences of the special restrictions of all his or her classes. (Exception: A character who acquires the barbarian class does not become illiterate.) </p>
<p>In the special case of turning undead, both clerics and experienced paladins have the same ability. If the character's paladin level is 4th or higher, her effective turning level is her cleric level plus her paladin level minus 3. </p>
<p>In the special case of uncanny dodge, both experienced barbarians and experienced rogues have the same ability. When a barbarian/rogue would gain uncanny dodge a second time (for her second class), she instead gains improved uncanny dodge, if she does not already have it. Her barbarian and rogue levels stack to determine the rogue level an attacker needs to flank her. </p>
<p>In the special case of obtaining a familiar, both wizards and sorcerers have the same ability. A sorcerer/wizard stacks his sorcerer and wizard levels to determine the familiar's natural armor, Intelligence score, and special abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Feats:</strong> A multiclass character gains feats based on character levels, regardless of individual class level</p>
<p><strong>Ability Increases:</strong> A multiclass character gains ability score increases based on character level, regardless of individual class level.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> The character gains spells from all of his or her spellcasting classes and keeps a separate spell list for each class. If a spell's effect is based on the class level of the caster, the player must keep track of which class's spell list the character is casting the spell from.</p>

<p>The barbarian's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

<h2 id="class-features"><a class="header" href="#class-features">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the barbarian.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Fast Movement (Ex):</strong> A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.</p>
<p><strong>Illiteracy:</strong> Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak.</p>
<p>A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.</p>
<p><strong>Rage (Ex):</strong> A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see below).</p>
<p>A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action, not in response to someone else's action.</p>
<p><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
<p><strong>Trap Sense (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Reduction (Ex):</strong> At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage Reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Rage (Ex):</strong> At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.</p>
<p><strong>Indomitable Will (Ex):</strong> While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.</p>
<p><strong>Tireless Rage (Ex):</strong> At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.</p>
<p><strong>Mighty Rage (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at -2.</p>
<h2 id="ex-barbarians"><a class="header" href="#ex-barbarians">Ex-Barbarians</a></h2>
<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. He retains all the other benefits of the class (damage reduction, fast movement, trap sense, and uncanny dodge).</p>

<p>Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 6 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-1"><a class="header" href="#class-features-1">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the bard.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard's Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Bard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. When Table: Bard Spells Known indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
<p>The bard's selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Bard Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Bard Spells Known are fixed.)</p>
<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard &quot;loses&quot; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
<p>As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level. </p>
<p><strong>Bardic Knowledge:</strong> A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)</p>
<p>A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random. </p>

<p><strong>Bardic Music:</strong> Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.</p>
<p>Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that doesn't require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.</p>
<p><strong>Countersong (Su):</strong> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself ) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don't allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Fascinate (Sp):</strong> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.</p>
<p>To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.</p>
<p>Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Courage (Su):</strong> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself ), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Competence (Su):</strong> A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally.</p>
<p>The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard's music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can't inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion (Sp):</strong> A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not break the bard's concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the fascinate effect.</p>
<p>Making a suggestion doesn't count against a bard's daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard's level + bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see mass suggestion, below). Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Greatness (Su):</strong> A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Song of Freedom (Sp):</strong> A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the break enchantment spell (caster level equals the character's bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can't use song of freedom on himself.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Heroics (Su):</strong> A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Mass Suggestion (Sp):</strong> This ability functions like suggestion, above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the suggestion simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated (see above). Mass suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.</p>

<p>In addition to the stated number of spells per day for 1st- through 9th-level spells, a cleric gets a domain spell for each spell level, starting at 1st.</p>
<p>The &quot;+1&quot; in the entries on this table represents that spell. Domain spells are in addition to any bonus spells the cleric may receive for having a high Wisdom score.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> A cleric's alignment must be within one step of his deity's (that is, it may be one step away on either the lawful-chaotic axis or the good-evil axis, but not both). A cleric may not be neutral unless his deity's alignment is also neutral.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8.</p>
<h2 id="class-skills-2"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-2">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The cleric's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). </p>
<p><strong>Domains and Class Skills:</strong> A cleric who chooses the Animal or Plant domain adds Knowledge (nature) (Int) to the cleric class skills listed above. A cleric who chooses the Knowledge domain adds all Knowledge (Int) skills to the list. A cleric who chooses the Travel domain adds Survival (Wis) to the list. A cleric who chooses the Trickery domain adds Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), and Hide (Dex) to the list. See Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells, below, for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (2 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-2"><a class="header" href="#class-features-2">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the cleric.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p>A cleric who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat related to his deity's weapon as a bonus feat. He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.</p>
<p><strong>Aura (Ex):</strong> A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment (see the detect evil spell for details). Clerics who don't worship a specific deity but choose the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the cleric spell list. However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities, Domains, and Domain Spells, below).</p>
<p>Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells:</strong> A cleric's deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to his deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.</p>
<p>If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two domains to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p>
<p>Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. The cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.</p>
<p>With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Casting:</strong> A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can &quot;lose&quot; any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with &quot;cure&quot; in its name). </p>
<p>An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can't convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with &quot;inflict&quot; in its name).</p>
<p>A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player's choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or commands undead (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:</strong> A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su):</strong> Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead).</p>
<p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see above).</p>
<p>A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Languages:</strong> A cleric's bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.</p>
<h2 id="ex-clerics"><a class="header" href="#ex-clerics">Ex-Clerics</a></h2>
<p>A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and class features, except for armor and shield proficiencies and proficiency with simple weapons. He cannot thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that god until he atones (see the atonement spell description).</p>

<h2 id="class-skills-3"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-3">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The druid's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str). </p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (4 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 4 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-3"><a class="header" href="#class-features-3">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the druid.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the ironwood spell description) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.</p>
<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below).</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. She does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.</p>
<p>A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place (but see Spontaneous Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Casting:</strong> A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &quot;lose&quot; a prepared spell in order to cast any summon nature's ally spell of the same level or lower. Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Languages:</strong> A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Companion (Ex):</strong> A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.</p>
<p>A 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As a druid advances in level, the animal's power increases as shown on the table. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
<p>A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see below). Should she select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character's druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, she can't have that animal as a companion.) </p>
<p><strong>Nature Sense (Ex):</strong> A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Empathy (Ex):</strong> A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.</p>
<p>The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
<p><strong>Woodland Stride (Ex):</strong> Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.</p>
<p><strong>Trackless Step (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
<p><strong>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex):</strong> Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Shape (Su):</strong> At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with. </p>
<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
<p>A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table: The Druid. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.</p>
<p>The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level.</p>
<p>At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature with the same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can't use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn't a creature.)</p>
<p>At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental's feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type.</p>
<p>At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.</p>
<p><strong>Venom Immunity (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons. </p>
<p><strong>A Thousand Faces (Su):</strong> At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
<p><strong>Timeless Body (Ex):</strong> After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place.</p>
<p>Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
<h2 id="ex-druids"><a class="header" href="#ex-druids">Ex-Druids</a></h2>
<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the atonement spell description).</p>
<h1 id="the-druids-animal-companion"><a class="header" href="#the-druids-animal-companion">The Druid's Animal Companion</a></h1>
<p>A druid's animal companion is different from a normal animal of its kind in many ways. A druid's animal companion is superior to a normal animal of its kind and has special powers, as described below.</p>

<p><strong>Animal Companion Basics:</strong> Use the base statistics for a creature of the companion's kind, but make the following changes.</p>
<p><strong>Class Level:</strong> The character's druid level. The druid's class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an animal companion for the purpose of determining the companion's abilities and the alternative lists available to the character.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus HD:</strong> Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Remember that extra Hit Dice improve the animal companion's base attack and base save bonuses. An animal companion's base attack bonus is the same as that of a druid of a level equal to the animal's HD. An animal companion has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's HD). An animal companion gains additional skill points and feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice.</p>
<p>**Natural Armor Adj.: **The number noted here is an improvement to the animal companion's existing natural armor bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Str/Dex Adj.:</strong> Add this value to the animal companion's Strength and Dexterity scores.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Tricks:</strong> The value given in this column is the total number of &quot;bonus&quot; tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the druid might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill). These bonus tricks don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don't count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can't be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Link (Ex):</strong> A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion.</p>
<p><strong>Share Spells (Ex):</strong> At the druid's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts upon herself also affect her animal companion. The animal companion must be within 5 feet of her at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the animal companion if the companion moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the animal again, even if it returns to the druid before the duration expires. </p>
<p>Additionally, the druid may cast a spell with a target of &quot;You&quot; on her animal companion (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A druid and her animal companion can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type (animal).</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.</p>
<p><strong>Devotion (Ex):</strong> An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
<p><strong>Multiattack:</strong> An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second attack with its primary natural weapon, albeit at a -5 penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an animal companion takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.</p>

<h2 id="class-features-5"><a class="header" href="#class-features-5">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the monk.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Monks are proficient with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and sling.</p>
<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields</p>
<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
<p><strong>AC Bonus (Ex):</strong> When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).</p>
<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
<p><strong>Flurry of Blows (Ex):</strong> When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack Bonus column on Table: The Monk. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.</p>
<p>When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus x ?1-1/2 or x?1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The monk can't use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.</p>
<p>In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so. </p>
<p>When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Unarmed Strike:</strong> At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
<p>Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
<p>A monk's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
<p>A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table: The Monk. The unarmed damage on Table: The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feat:</strong> At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Movement (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed, as shown on Table: The Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
<p><strong>Still Mind (Ex):</strong> A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.</p>
<p><strong>Ki Strike (Su):</strong> At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. Ki strike improves with the character's monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Fall (Ex):</strong> At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk's ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her descent and fall any distance without harm.</p>
<p><strong>Purity of Body (Ex):</strong> At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Wholeness of Body (Su):</strong> At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Diamond Body (Su):</strong> At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.</p>
<p><strong>Abundant Step (Su):</strong> At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door, once per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded down).</p>
<p><strong>Diamond Soul (Ex):</strong> At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Quivering Palm (Su):</strong> Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.</p>
<p><strong>Timeless Body (Ex):</strong> Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
<p><strong>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex):</strong> A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.</p>
<p><strong>Empty Body (Su):</strong> At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using the spell etherealness. She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Self:</strong> At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.</p>
<h2 id="ex-monks"><a class="header" href="#ex-monks">Ex-Monks</a></h2>
<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>
<p>Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a multiclass character, but multiclass monks face a special restriction. A monk who gains a new class or (if already multiclass) raises another class by a level may never again raise her monk level, though she retains all her monk abilities.</p>

<p>All of the following are class features of the paladin.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Good (Ex):</strong> The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to her paladin level.</p>
<p><strong>Detect Evil (Sp):</strong> At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Smite Evil (Su):</strong> Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.</p>
<p>At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.</p>
<p>Divine Grace (Su): At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
<p><strong>Lay on Hands (Su):</strong> Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn't have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Courage (Su):</strong> Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.</p>
<p>This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Health (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Turn Undead (Su):</strong> When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of three levels lower would.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Paladin. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Paladin indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level The paladin does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.</p>
<p>A paladin prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to spontaneously cast a cure spell in its place. A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
<p>Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is one-half her paladin level.</p>
<p><strong>Special Mount (Sp):</strong> Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin gains the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil (see below). This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin).</p>
<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the celestial realms in which it resides. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the paladin may release a particular mount from service.</p>
<p>Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect.</p>
<p>Should the paladin's mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The paladin may not summon another mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first, even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the paladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Remove Disease (Sp):</strong> At 6th level, a paladin can produce a remove disease effect, as the spell, once per week. She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth).</p>
<p><strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act.</p>
<p>Additionally, a paladin's code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.</p>
<p><strong>Associates:</strong> While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.</p>
<h2 id="ex-paladins"><a class="header" href="#ex-paladins">Ex-Paladins</a></h2>
<p>A paladin who ceases to be lawful good, who willfully commits an evil act, or who grossly violates the code of conduct loses all paladin spells and abilities (including the service of the paladin's mount, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She may not progress any farther in levels as a paladin. She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations (see the atonement spell description), as appropriate.</p>
<p>Like a member of any other class, a paladin may be a multiclass character, but multiclass paladins face a special restriction. A paladin who gains a level in any class other than paladin may never again raise her paladin level, though she retains all her paladin abilities.</p>
<h2 id="the-paladins-mount"><a class="header" href="#the-paladins-mount">The Paladin's Mount</a></h2>
<p>The paladin's mount is superior to a normal mount of its kind and has special powers, as described below. The standard mount for a Medium paladin is a heavy warhorse, and the standard mount for a Small paladin is a warpony. Another kind of mount, such as a riding dog (for a halfling paladin) or a Large shark (for a paladin in an aquatic campaign) may be allowed as well.</p>
<p>A paladin's mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects that depend on its type (though it retains an animal's HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).</p>

<p><strong>Paladin's Mount Basics:</strong> Use the base statistics for a creature of the mount's kind, but make changes to take into account the attributes and characteristics summarized on the table and described below.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus HD:</strong> Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve the mount's base attack and base save bonuses. A special mount's base attack bonus is equal to that of a cleric of a level equal to the mount's HD. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's HD). The mount gains additional skill points or feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Armor Adj.:</strong> The number on the table is an improvement to the mount's existing natural armor bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Str Adj.:</strong> Add this figure to the mount's Strength score.</p>
<p><strong>Int:</strong> The mount's Intelligence score.</p>
<p><strong>Empathic Link (Su):</strong> The paladin has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The paladin cannot see through the mount's eyes, but they can communicate empathically.</p>
<p>Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible.</p>
<p>Because of this empathic link, the paladin has the same connection to an item or place that her mount does, just as with a master and his familiar (see Familiars).</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.</p>
<p><strong>Share Spells:</strong> At the paladin's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount. </p>
<p>The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before the duration expires. Additionally, the paladin may cast a spell with a target of &quot;You&quot; on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A paladin and her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount's type (magical beast).</p>
<p><strong>Share Saving Throws:</strong> For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the paladin's, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any other bonuses on saves that the master might have.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Speed (Ex):</strong> The mount's speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Command (Sp):</strong> Once per day per two paladin levels of its master, a mount can use this ability to command other any normal animal of approximately the same kind as itself (for warhorses and warponies, this category includes donkeys, mules, and ponies), as long as the target creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount. This ability functions like the command spell, but the mount must make a DC 21 Concentration check to succeed if it's being ridden at the time. If the check fails, the ability does not work that time, but it still counts against the mount's daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin's level + paladin's Cha modifier) to negate the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Resistance (Ex):</strong> A mount's spell resistance equals its master's paladin level + 5. To affect the mount with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the mount's spell resistance.</p>

<h2 id="class-skills-7"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-7">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The ranger's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Search (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Rope (Dex).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (6 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 6 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-7"><a class="header" href="#class-features-7">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the ranger.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Favored Enemy (Ex):</strong> At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table: Ranger Favored Enemies. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.</p>
<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. </p>
<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>
<p><strong>Track:</strong> A ranger gains Track as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Empathy (Ex):</strong> A ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Style (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character's class features but does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any way.</p>
<p>If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Companion (Ex):</strong> At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures may be added to the ranger's list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind.</p>
<p>This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except that the ranger's effective druid level is one-half his ranger level. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The ranger does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.</p>
<p>A ranger prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though he cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his ranger level.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Combat Style (Ex):</strong> At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>Woodland Stride (Ex):</strong> Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
<p>However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him.</p>
<p><strong>Swift Tracker (Ex):</strong> Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Style Mastery (Ex):</strong> At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Precise Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p>
<p>As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>Camouflage (Ex):</strong> A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
<p><strong>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):</strong> While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Hide skill even while being observed.</p>

<h2 id="class-skills-8"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-8">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The rogue's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Forgery (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (local) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), Use Magic Device (Cha), and Use Rope (Dex).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (8 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 8 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-8"><a class="header" href="#class-features-8">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the rogue.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
<p><strong>Sneak Attack:</strong> If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
<p>The rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.</p>
<p>Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
<p>With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.</p>
<p>A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies--undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.</p>
<p><strong>Trapfinding:</strong> Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. </p>
<p>Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.</p>
<p>Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.</p>
<p>A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Trap Sense (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.</p>
<p>Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
<p><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.</p>
<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked.</p>
<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.</p>
<p><strong>Crippling Strike (Ex):</strong> A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.</p>
<p><strong>Defensive Roll (Ex):</strong> The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll--if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunist (Ex):</strong> Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue's attack of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can't use the opportunist ability more than once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Mastery:</strong> The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time.</p>
<p><strong>Slippery Mind (Ex):</strong> This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.</p>
<p><strong>Feat:</strong> A rogue may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.</p>

<p>The sorcerer's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (2 + Int modifier) x 4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-9"><a class="header" href="#class-features-9">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer's gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see below).</p>
<p>To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer's Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.</p>
<p>A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. The sorcerer can't use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.</p>
<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer &quot;loses&quot; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can cast. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
<p>Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he'll cast.</p>
<p><strong>Familiar:</strong> A sorcerer can obtain a familiar (see below). Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.</p>
<p>The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.</p>
<p>If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer's experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.</p>
<p>A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.</p>

<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d4.</p>
<h2 id="class-skills-10"><a class="header" href="#class-skills-10">Class Skills</a></h2>
<p>The wizard's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4: Skills for skill descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (2 + Int modifier) x4.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<h2 id="class-features-10"><a class="header" href="#class-features-10">Class Features</a></h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the wizard.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard's movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
<p><strong>Spells:</strong> A wizard casts arcane spells which are drawn from the sorcerer/ wizard spell list. A wizard must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time (see below).</p>
<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard's Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Wizard. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.</p>
<p>Unlike a bard or sorcerer, a wizard may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting a good night's sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Languages:</strong> A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
<p><strong>Familiar:</strong> A wizard can obtain a familiar in exactly the same manner as a sorcerer can. See the sorcerer description and the information on Familiars below for details.</p>
<p><strong>Scribe Scroll:</strong> At 1st level, a wizard gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. </p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.</p>
<p>These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing these feats.</p>
<p><strong>Spellbooks:</strong> A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic, which all wizards can prepare from memory.</p>
<p>A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited school or schools, if any; see School Specialization, below) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards' spellbooks to her own.</p>
<h2 id="school-specialization"><a class="header" href="#school-specialization">School Specialization</a></h2>
<p>A school is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common theme. If desired, a wizard may specialize in one school of magic (see below). Specialization allows a wizard to cast extra spells from her chosen school, but she then never learns to cast spells from some other schools.</p>
<p>A specialist wizard can prepare one additional spell of her specialty school per spell level each day. She also gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.</p>
<p>The wizard must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose her specialty at 1st level. At this time, she must also give up two other schools of magic (unless she chooses to specialize in divination; see below), which become her prohibited schools.</p>
<p>A wizard can never give up divination to fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>Spells of the prohibited school or schools are not available to the wizard, and she can't even cast such spells from scrolls or fire them from wands. She may not change either her specialization or her prohibited schools later.</p>
<p>The eight schools of arcane magic are abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation.</p>
<p>Spells that do not fall into any of these schools are called universal spells.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abjuration:</strong> Spells that protect, block, or banish. An abjuration specialist is called an abjurer.</li>
<li><strong>Conjuration:</strong> Spells that bring creatures or materials to the caster. A conjuration specialist is called a conjurer.</li>
<li><strong>Divination:</strong> Spells that reveal information. A divination specialist is called a diviner. Unlike the other specialists, a diviner must give up only one other school.</li>
<li><strong>Enchantment:</strong> Spells that imbue the recipient with some property or grant the caster power over another being. An enchantment specialist is called an enchanter.</li>
<li><strong>Evocation:</strong> Spells that manipulate energy or create something from nothing. An evocation specialist is called an evoker.</li>
<li><strong>Illusion:</strong> Spells that alter perception or create false images. An illusion specialist is called an illusionist.</li>
<li><strong>Necromancy:</strong> Spells that manipulate, create, or destroy life or life force. A necromancy specialist is called a necromancer.</li>
<li><strong>Transmutation:</strong> Spells that transform the recipient physically or change its properties in a more subtle way. A transmutation specialist is called a transmuter.</li>
<li><strong>Universal:</strong> Not a school, but a category for spells that all wizards can learn. A wizard cannot select universal as a specialty school or as a prohibited school. Only a limited number of spells fall into this category.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="familiars"><a class="header" href="#familiars">Familiars</a></h2>
<p>A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.</p>
<p>A familiar also grants special abilities to its master (a sorcerer or wizard), as given on the table below. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.</p>
<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master's level.</p>

<h3 id="familiar-basics"><a class="header" href="#familiar-basics">Familiar Basics</a></h3>
<p>Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar's kind, but make the following changes:</p>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal HD total, whichever is higher.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> The familiar has one-half the master's total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.</p>
<p><strong>Attacks:</strong> Use the master's base attack bonus, as calculated from all his classes. Use the familiar's Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the familiar's melee attack bonus with natural weapons.</p>
<p>Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind.</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> For each saving throw, use either the familiar's base save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the master's (as calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or the master's skill ranks, whichever are better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar's total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar's ability to use.</p>
<h3 id="familiar-ability-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#familiar-ability-descriptions">Familiar Ability Descriptions</a></h3>
<p>All familiars have special abilities (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the master's combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table below. The abilities given on the table are cumulative.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Natural Armor Adj.:</strong> The number noted here is an improvement to the familiar's existing natural armor bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Int:</strong> The familiar's Intelligence score.</p>
<p><strong>Alertness (Ex):</strong> While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master gains the Alertness feat.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.</p>
<p><strong>Share Spells:</strong> At the master's option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his familiar. The familiar must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit.</p>
<p>If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the familiar if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the familiar again even if it returns to the master before the duration expires. Additionally, the master may cast a spell with a target of &quot;You&quot; on his familiar (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself.</p>
<p>A master and his familiar can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the familiar's type (magical beast).</p>
<p><strong>Empathic Link (Su):</strong> The master has an empathic link with his familiar out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The master cannot see through the familiar's eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.</p>
<p>Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.</p>
<p><strong>Deliver Touch Spells (Su):</strong> If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the &quot;toucher.&quot; The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.</p>
<p><strong>Speak with Master (Ex):</strong> If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.</p>
<p><strong>Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex):</strong> If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with amphibians, weasels with similar creatures (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks, wolverines, and badgers). Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Resistance (Ex):</strong> If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar's spell resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Scry on Familiar (Sp):</strong> If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the scrying spell) once per day.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="skills"><a class="header" href="#skills">Skills</a></h1>
<p>If you buy a class skill, your character gets 1 rank (equal to a +1 bonus on checks with that skill) for each skill point. If you buy other classes' skills (cross-class skills), you get 1/2 rank per skill point.</p>
<p>Your maximum rank in a class skill is your character level + 3.</p>
<p>Your maximum rank in a cross-class skill is one-half of this number (do not round up or down).</p>
<p><strong>Using Skills:</strong> To make a skill check, roll: 1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier = skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)</p>
<p>This roll works just like an attack roll or a saving throw-- the higher the roll, the better. Either you're trying to match or exceed a certain Difficulty Class (DC), or you're trying to beat another character's check result.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Ranks:</strong> A character's number of ranks in a skill is based on how many skill points a character has invested in a skill. Many skills can be used even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making an untrained skill check.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Modifier:</strong> The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill's key ability (the ability associated with the skill's use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Modifiers:</strong> Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.</p>
<p>Each skill point you spend on a class skill gets you 1 rank in that skill. Class skills are the skills found on your character's class skill list. Each skill point you spend on a cross-class skill gets your character 1/2 rank in that skill. Cross-class skills are skills not found on your character's class skill list. (Half ranks do not improve your skill check, but two 1/2 ranks make 1 rank.) You can't save skill points to spend later.</p>
<p>The maximum rank in a class skill is the character's level + 3. If it's a cross-class skill, the maximum rank is half of that number (do not round up or down).</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a skill is purchased as a class skill or a cross-class skill, if it is a class skill for any of your classes, your maximum rank equals your total character level + 3.</p>
<h2 id="using-skills"><a class="header" href="#using-skills">Using Skills</a></h2>
<p>When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well he or she does. The higher the result of the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.</p>
<p>Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise he or she would fail.</p>
<h2 id="skill-checks"><a class="header" href="#skill-checks">Skill Checks</a></h2>
<p>A skill check takes into account a character's training (skill rank), natural talent (ability modifier), and luck (the die roll). It may also take into account his or her race's knack for doing certain things (racial bonus) or what armor he or she is wearing (armor check penalty), or a certain feat the character possesses, among other things. </p>
<p>To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character's skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the character's ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill's key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply, including racial bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.</p>
<h3 id="difficulty-class"><a class="header" href="#difficulty-class">Difficulty Class</a></h3>
<p>Some checks are made against a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC is a number (set using the skill rules as a guideline) that you must score as a result on your skill check in order to succeed.</p>

<h3 id="opposed-checks"><a class="header" href="#opposed-checks">Opposed Checks</a></h3>
<p>An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character's check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher skill modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.</p>

<ol>
<li>An Intimidate check is opposed by the target's level check, not a skill check. See the Intimidate skill description for more information.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="trying-again"><a class="header" href="#trying-again">Trying Again</a></h3>
<p>In general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some skills, however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.</p>
<h3 id="untrained-skill-checks"><a class="header" href="#untrained-skill-checks">Untrained Skill Checks</a></h3>
<p>Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill he or she does not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The skill modifier doesn't have a skill rank added in because the character has no ranks in the skill. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the modifier for the skill's key ability, are applied to the check.</p>
<p>Many skills can be used only by someone who is trained in them.</p>
<h3 id="favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions"><a class="header" href="#favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions">Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions</a></h3>
<p>Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.</p>
<p>The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent conditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the skill user a -2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can be subpar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conditions that affect your character's ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check's DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.</p>
<h3 id="time-and-skill-checks"><a class="header" href="#time-and-skill-checks">Time and Skill Checks</a></h3>
<p>Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action.</p>
<p>These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.</p>
<h3 id="checks-without-rolls"><a class="header" href="#checks-without-rolls">Checks without Rolls</a></h3>
<p>A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.</p>
<p>Taking 10: When your character is not being threatened or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure --you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn't help.</p>
<p><strong>Taking 20:</strong> When you have plenty of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one standard action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no penalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, eventually you will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.</p>
<p>Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes twenty times as long as making a single check would take.</p>
<p>Since taking 20 assumes that the character will fail many times before succeeding, if you did attempt to take 20 on a skill that carries penalties for failure, your character would automatically incur those penalties before he or she could complete the task. Common &quot;take 20&quot; skills include Escape Artist, Open Lock, and Search.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Checks and Caster Level Checks:</strong> The normal take 10 and take 20 rules apply for ability checks. Neither rule applies to caster level checks.</p>
<h2 id="combining-skill-attempts"><a class="header" href="#combining-skill-attempts">Combining Skill Attempts</a></h2>
<p>When more than one character tries the same skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may overlap.</p>
<h3 id="individual-events"><a class="header" href="#individual-events">Individual Events</a></h3>
<p>Often, several characters attempt some action and each succeeds or fails independently.  The result of one character's Climb check does not influence the results of other characters Climb check.</p>
<h3 id="aid-another"><a class="header" href="#aid-another">Aid Another</a></h3>
<p>You can help another character achieve success on his or her skill check by making the same kind of skill check in a cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to his or her check, as per the rule for favorable conditions. (You can't take 10 on a skill check to aid another.) In many cases, a character's help won't be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once. </p>
<p>In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you can't aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn't achieve alone.</p>
<h2 id="skill-synergy"><a class="header" href="#skill-synergy">Skill Synergy</a></h2>
<p>It's possible for a character to have two skills that work well together. In general, having 5 or more ranks in one skill gives the character a +2 bonus on skill checks with each of its synergistic skills, as noted in the skill description. In some cases, this bonus applies only to specific uses of the skill in question, and not to all checks. Some skills provide benefits on other checks made by a character, such as those checks required to use certain class features.</p>
<h2 id="ability-checks"><a class="header" href="#ability-checks">Ability Checks</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes a character tries to do something to which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate ability modifier. Essentially, you're making an untrained skill check. </p>
<p>In some cases, an action is a straight test of one's ability with no luck involved. Just as you wouldn't make a height check to see who is taller, you don't make a Strength check to see who is stronger.</p>
<h2 id="skill-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#skill-descriptions">Skill Descriptions</a></h2>
<p>This section describes each skill, including common uses and typical modifiers. Characters can sometimes use skills for purposes other than those noted here.</p>
<p>Here is the format for skill descriptions.</p>
<h1 id="skill-name"><a class="header" href="#skill-name">SKILL NAME</a></h1>
<p>The skill name line includes (in addition to the name of the skill) the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Ability:</strong> The abbreviation of the ability whose modifier applies to the skill check. Exception: Speak Language has &quot;None&quot; as its key ability because the use of this skill does not require a check.</li>
<li><strong>Trained Only:</strong> If this notation is included in the skill name line, you must have at least 1 rank in the skill to use it. If it is omitted, the skill can be used untrained (with a rank of 0). If any special notes apply to trained or untrained use, they are covered in the Untrained section (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Armor Check Penalty:</strong> If this notation is included in the skill name line, an armor check penalty applies (when appropriate) to checks using this skill. If this entry is absent, an armor check penalty does not apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill name line is followed by a general description of what using the skill represents. After the description are a few other types of information:</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> What a character (&quot;you&quot; in the skill description) can do with a successful skill check and the check's DC.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> The type of action using the skill requires, or the amount of time required for a check.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Any conditions that apply to successive attempts to use the skill successfully. If the skill doesn't allow you to attempt the same task more than once, or if failure carries an inherent penalty (such as with the Climb skill), you can't take 20. If this paragraph is omitted, the skill can be retried without any inherent penalty, other than the additional time required.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Any extra facts that apply to the skill, such as special effects deriving from its use or bonuses that certain characters receive because of class, feat choices, or race.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> Some skills grant a bonus to the use of one or more other skills because of a synergistic effect. This entry, when present, indicates what bonuses this skill may grant or receive because of such synergies. See Table 4-5 for a complete list of bonuses granted by synergy between skills (or between a skill and a class feature).</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> The full utility of certain skills is restricted to characters of certain classes or characters who possess certain feats. This entry indicates whether any such restrictions exist for the skill.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> This entry indicates what a character without at least 1 rank in the skill can do with it. If this entry doesn't appear, it means that the skill functions normally for untrained characters (if it can be used untrained) or that an untrained character can't attempt checks with this skill (for skills that are designated as &quot;Trained Only&quot;).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="appraise-int"><a class="header" href="#appraise-int">Appraise (Int)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual value.</p>
<p>Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item's value.</p>
<p>A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed, such as a gem. A merchant's scale gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals.</p>
<p>These bonuses stack.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions).</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> No. You cannot try again on the same object, regardless of success.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A dwarf gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items because dwarves are familiar with valuable items of all kinds (especially those made of stone or metal).</p>
<p>The master of a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks.</p>
<p>A character with the Diligent feat gets a +2 bonus on Appraise checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 ranks in any Craft skill, you gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> For common items, failure on an untrained check means no estimate. For rare items, success means an estimate of 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="balance-dex-armor-check-penalty"><a class="header" href="#balance-dex-armor-check-penalty">Balance (Dex; Armor Check Penalty)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can't move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface, as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Narrow Surface</th><th align="center">Balance DC<sup>1</sup></th><th align="left">Difficult Surface</th><th align="center">Balance DC<sup>1</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody>

</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Add modifiers from Narrow Surface Modifiers, below, as appropriate.</li>
<li>Only if running or charging. Failure by 4 or less means the character can't run or charge, but may otherwise act normally.</li>
</ol>
<p>Narrow Surface Modifiers (These modifiers stack)</p>

<tr><td align="left">Sloped or angled</td><td align="center">+2</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Add the appropriate modifier to the Balance DC of a narrow surface.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Being Attacked while Balancing:</strong> You are considered flat-footed while balancing, since you can't move to avoid a blow, and thus you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you aren't considered flat-footed while balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Balance check against the same DC to remain standing.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerated Movement:</strong> You can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a -5 penalty, you can move your full speed as a move action. (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each move action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to charge across a precarious surface; charging requires one Balance check for each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof ) that you charge.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> None. A Balance check doesn't require an action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bluff-cha"><a class="header" href="#bluff-cha">Bluff (Cha)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> A Bluff check is opposed by the target's Sense Motive check. See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target's Sense Motive check for each one.</p>
<p>Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it's important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn't believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn't so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.</p>
<p>A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a suggestion spell. </p>
<p>A bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.</p>
<p><strong>Feinting in Combat:</strong> You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can't dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target's Sense Motive check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers.</p>
<p>If your Bluff check result exceeds this special Sense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your next turn.</p>
<p>Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it's harder to read a strange creature's body language; you take a -4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it's even harder; you take a -8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it's impossible.</p>
<p>Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Diversion to Hide:</strong> You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Delivering a Secret Message:</strong> You can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can't get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see Sense Motive).</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A Bluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a standard action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn't take an action; it is part of normal communication.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per round.</p>
<p>Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>
<p>The master of a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
<p>If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand checks, as well as on Disguise checks made when you know you're being observed and you try to act in character.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="climb-str-armor-check-penalty"><a class="header" href="#climb-str-armor-check-penalty">Climb (Str; Armor Check Penalty)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.</p>
<p>A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.</p>
<p>A climber's kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks.</p>
<p>The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb. Compare the task with those on the following table to determine an appropriate DC.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="center">Climb DC</th><th>Example Surface or Activity</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="center">0</td><td>A slope too steep to walk up, or a knotted rope with a wall to brace against.</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">20</td><td>An uneven surface with some narrow handholds and footholds, such as a typical wall in a dungeon or ruins.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">25</td><td>A rough surface, such as a natural rock wall or a brick wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">25</td><td>An overhang or ceiling with handholds but no footholds.</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">+5</td><td>Surface is slippery (increases DC by 5).</td></tr>

<ol>
<li>These modifiers are cumulative; use any that apply.</li>
</ol>
<p>You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand. While climbing, you can't move to avoid a blow, so you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can't use a shield while climbing.</p>
<p>Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerated Climbing:</strong> You try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a -5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter your speed).</p>
<p><strong>Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds:</strong> You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.</p>
<p><strong>Catching Yourself When Falling:</strong> It's practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 20) to do so. It's much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope's DC + 10).</p>
<p><strong>Catching a Falling Character While Climbing:</strong> If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character's fall but don't lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character's fall and begin falling as well.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Climbing is part of movement, so it's generally part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn't take an action.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can use a rope to haul a character upward (or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum load in this manner.</p>
<p>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks because halflings are agile and surefooted.</p>
<p>The master of a lizard familiar gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks.</p>
<p>If you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks.</p>
<p>A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher than 0, but it always can choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. Such a creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="concentration-con"><a class="header" href="#concentration-con">Concentration (Con)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity. In general, if an action wouldn't normally provoke an attack of opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted.</p>
<p>If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a spell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were using a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other ramifications as well.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the spell you are trying to cast to the appropriate Concentration DC. If more than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each one; any failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not completed.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you are trying to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell when the distraction occurs, add the level of the spell to the indicated DC.</li>
<li>Such as during the casting of a spell with a casting time of 1 round or more, or the execution of an activity that takes more than a single full-round action (such as Disable Device). Also, damage stemming from an attack of opportunity or readied attack made in response to the spell being cast (for spells with a casting time of 1 action) or the action being taken (for activities requiring no more than a full-round action).</li>
<li>Such as from acid arrow.</li>
<li>If the spell allows no save, use the save DC it would have if it did allow a save.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> None. Making a Concentration check doesn't take an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively).</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, though a success doesn't cancel the effect of a previous failure, such as the loss of a spell you were casting or the disruption of a spell you were concentrating on.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can use Concentration to cast a spell, use a spell-like ability, or use a skill defensively, so as to avoid attacks of opportunity altogether. This doesn't apply to other actions that might provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>The DC of the check is 15 (plus the spell's level, if casting a spell or using a spell-like ability defensively). If the Concentration check succeeds, you may attempt the action normally without provoking any attacks of opportunity. A successful Concentration check still doesn't allow you to take 10 on another check if you are in a stressful situation; you must make the check normally. If the Concentration check fails, the related action also automatically fails (with any appropriate ramifications), and the action is wasted, just as if your concentration had been disrupted by a distraction. </p>
<p>A character with the Combat Casting feat gets a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while on the defensive or while grappling or pinned.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="craft-int"><a class="header" href="#craft-int">Craft (Int)</a></h1>
<p>Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.</p>
<p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill.</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft's daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p>
<p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item's finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.</p>
<p>In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.</p>
<p>When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p>
<p>All crafts require artisan's tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a -2 circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan's tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>
<p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the item's price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the DC from the table below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay one-third of the item's price for the cost of raw materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week's work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result x the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result x the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you've completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result x the DC doesn't equal the price, then it represents the progress you've made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week.</p>
<p>If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
<p><strong>Progress by the Day:</strong> You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result x DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Masterwork Items:</strong> You can make a masterwork item--a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.</p>
<p><strong>Repairing Items:</strong> Generally, you can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item's price. </p>
<p>When you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of item, the DC for checks involving the creation of that item are typically as given on the following table.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Item</th><th align="center">Craft Skill</th><th align="center">Craft DC</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<ol>
<li>You must be a spellcaster to craft any of these items.</li>
<li>Traps have their own rules for construction.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Does not apply. Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A dwarf has a +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal, because dwarves are especially capable with stonework and metalwork.</p>
<p>A gnome has a +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because gnomes have sensitive noses.</p>
<p>You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item. This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you'll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.</p>
<p>To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment and be a spellcaster. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist's lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 ranks in a Craft skill, you get a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="decipher-script-int-trained-only"><a class="header" href="#decipher-script-int-trained-only">Decipher Script (Int; Trained Only)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing.</p>
<p>If the check succeeds, you understand the general content of a piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check fails, make a DC 5 Wisdom check to see if you avoid drawing a false conclusion about the text. (Success means that you do not draw a false conclusion; failure means that you do.)</p>
<p>Both the Decipher Script check and (if necessary) the Wisdom check are made secretly, so that you can't tell whether the conclusion you draw is true or false.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Deciphering the equivalent of a single page of script takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions).</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A character with the Diligent feat gets a +2 bonus on Decipher Script checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks involving scrolls.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="diplomacy-cha"><a class="header" href="#diplomacy-cha">Diplomacy (Cha)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can change the attitudes of others (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check; see the Influencing NPC Attitudes sidebar, below, for basic DCs. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and the winner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when two advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a third party.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Changing others' attitudes with Diplomacy generally takes at least 1 full minute (10 consecutive full-round actions). In some situations, this time requirement may greatly increase. A rushed Diplomacy check can be made as a full-round action, but you take a -10 penalty on the check.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial Diplomacy check succeeds, the other character can be persuaded only so far, and a retry may do more harm than good. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly committed to his position, and a retry is futile.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>
<p>If you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, Knowledge (nobility and royalty), or Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>

<p><strong>Check:</strong> The Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don't necessarily know whether you've succeeded.</p>
<p>The DC depends on how tricky the device is. Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a fairly simple device has a DC of 10; more intricate and complex devices have higher DCs.</p>
<p>If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. If you're attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.</p>
<p>You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).</p>

<ol>
<li>If you attempt to leave behind no trace of your tampering, add 5 to the DC.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a full-round action. An intricate or complex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. You can retry if you have missed the check by 4 or less, though you must be aware that you have failed in order to try again.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Nimble Fingers feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disable Device checks.</p>
<p>A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more can study the trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (along with her companions) without disarming it.</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> Rogues (and other characters with the trapfinding class feature) can disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create it.</p>
<p>The spells fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol, and teleportation circle also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a successful Disable Device check. Spike growth and spike stones, however, create magic traps against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.</p>
<h2 id="other-ways-to-beat-a-trap"><a class="header" href="#other-ways-to-beat-a-trap">Other Ways To Beat A Trap</a></h2>
<p>It's possible to ruin many traps without making a Disable Device check.</p>
<p><strong>Ranged Attack Traps:</strong> Once a trap's location is known, the obvious way to ruin it is to smash the mechanism--assuming the mechanism can be accessed. Failing that, it's possible to plug up the holes from which the projectiles emerge. Doing this prevents the trap from firing unless its ammunition does enough damage to break through the plugs.</p>
<p><strong>Melee Attack Traps:</strong> These devices can be thwarted by smashing the mechanism or blocking the weapons, as noted above. Alternatively, if a character studies the trap as it triggers, he might be able to time his dodges just right to avoid damage. A character who is doing nothing but studying a trap when it first goes off gains a +4 dodge bonus against its attacks if it is triggered again within the next minute.</p>
<p><strong>Pits:</strong> Disabling a pit trap generally ruins only the trapdoor, making it an uncovered pit. Filling in the pit or building a makeshift bridge across it is an application of manual labor, not the Disable Device skill. Characters could neutralize any spikes at the bottom of a pit by attacking them--they break just as daggers do.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Traps:</strong> Dispel magic helps here. Someone who succeeds on a caster level check against the level of the trap's creator suppresses the trap for 1d4 rounds. This works only with a targeted dispel magic, not the area version (see the spell description).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="disguise-cha"><a class="header" href="#disguise-cha">Disguise (Cha)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others' Spot check results. If you don't draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Spot checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Spot checks.</p>
<p>You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people are making Spot checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can't be sure how good the result is.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of your disguise depends in part on how much you're attempting to change your appearance.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Disguise</th><th align="center">Disguise Check Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<ol>
<li>These modifiers are cumulative; use any that apply.</li>
<li>Per step of difference between your actual age category and your disguised age category. The steps are: young (younger than adulthood), adulthood, middle age, old, and venerable.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like get a bonus on their Spot checks according to the table below. Furthermore, they are automatically considered to be suspicious of you, so opposed checks are always called for.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>Usually, an individual makes a Spot check to see through your disguise immediately upon meeting you and each hour thereafter. If you casually meet many different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average Spot modifier for the group. </p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Creating a disguise requires 1d3x10 minutes of work.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. You may try to redo a failed disguise, but once others know that a disguise was attempted, they'll be more suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Magic that alters your form, such as alter self, disguise self, polymorph, or shapechange, grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks (see the individual spell descriptions). You must succeed on a Disguise check with a +10 bonus to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual using the veil spell. Divination magic that allows people to see through illusions (such as true seeing) does not penetrate a mundane disguise, but it can negate the magical component of a magically enhanced one.</p>
<p>You must make a Disguise check when you cast a simulacrum spell to determine how good the likeness is.</p>
<p>If you have the Deceitful feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disguise checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Disguise checks when you know that you're being observed and you try to act in character.</p>

<p><strong>Check:</strong> The table below gives the DCs to escape various forms of restraints.</p>
<p><strong>Ropes:</strong> Your Escape Artist check is opposed by the binder's Use Rope check. Since it's easier to tie someone up than to escape from being tied up, the binder gets a +10 bonus on his or her check.</p>
<p>Manacles and Masterwork Manacles: The DC for manacles is set by their construction.</p>
<p><strong>Tight Space:</strong> The DC noted on the table is for getting through a space where your head fits but your shoulders don't. If the space is long you may need to make multiple checks. You can't get through a space that your head does not fit through.</p>
<p><strong>Grappler:</strong> You can make an Escape Artist check opposed by your enemy's grapple check to get out of a grapple or out of a pinned condition (so that you're only grappling).</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Making an Escape Artist check to escape from rope bindings, manacles, or other restraints (except a grappler) requires 1 minute of work. Escaping from a net or an animate rope, command plants, control plants, or entangle spell is a full-round action. Escaping from a grapple or pin is a standard action. Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on how long the space is.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. You can make another check after a failed check if you're squeezing your way through a tight space, making multiple checks. If the situation permits, you can make additional checks, or even take 20, as long as you're not being actively opposed.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks to bind someone.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks when escaping from rope bonds.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="forgery-int"><a class="header" href="#forgery-int">Forgery (Int)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged, enough light or sufficient visual acuity to see the details of what you're writing, wax for seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a government decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that person's handwriting is needed.</p>
<p>The Forgery check is made secretly, so that you're not sure how good your forgery is. As with Disguise, you don't even need to make a check until someone examines the work. Your Forgery check is opposed by the Forgery check of the person who examines the document to check its authenticity. The examiner gains modifiers on his or her check if any of the conditions on the table below exist.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Condition</th><th align="center">Reader's Forgery Check Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>

</tbody></table>
<p>A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous knowledge, or one that requires sacrifice on the part of the person checking the document can increase that character's suspicion (and thus create favorable circumstances for the checker's opposing Forgery check).</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Forging a very short and simple document takes about 1 minute. A longer or more complex document takes 1d4 minutes per page.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Usually, no. A retry is never possible after a particular reader detects a particular forgery. But the document created by the forger might still fool someone else. The result of a Forgery check for a particular document must be used for every instance of a different reader examining the document. No reader can attempt to detect a particular forgery more than once; if that one opposed check goes in favor of the forger, then the reader can't try using his own skill again, even if he's suspicious about the document.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Deceitful feat, you get a +2 bonus on Forgery checks.</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> Forgery is language-dependent; thus, to forge documents and detect forgeries, you must be able to read and write the language in question. A barbarian can't learn the Forgery skill unless he has learned to read and write.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="gather-information-cha"><a class="header" href="#gather-information-cha">Gather Information (Cha)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> An evening's time, a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making friends, and a DC 10 Gather Information check get you a general idea of a city's major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would be withheld. The higher your check result, the better the information.</p>
<p>If you want to find out about a specific rumor, or a specific item, or obtain a map, or do something else along those lines, the DC for the check is 15 to 25, or even higher.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> A typical Gather Information check takes 1d4+1 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, but it takes time for each check. Furthermore, you may draw attention to yourself if you repeatedly pursue a certain type of information.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Gather Information checks.</p>
<p>If you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks.</p>

<p><strong>Handle an Animal:</strong> This task involves commanding an animal to perform a task or trick that it knows. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Push&quot; an Animal:</strong> To push an animal means to get it to perform a task or trick that it doesn't know but is physically capable of performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p>
<p><strong>Teach an Animal a Trick:</strong> You can teach an animal a specific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal check against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following.</p>
<p><strong>Attack (DC 20):</strong> The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks.</p>
<p><strong>Come (DC 15):</strong> The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.</p>
<p><strong>Defend (DC 20):</strong> The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character.</p>
<p><strong>Down (DC 15):</strong> The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn't know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.</p>
<p><strong>Fetch (DC 15):</strong> The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.</p>
<p><strong>Guard (DC 20):</strong> The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.</p>
<p><strong>Heel (DC 15):</strong> The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn't go.</p>
<p><strong>Perform (DC 15):</strong> The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Seek (DC 15):</strong> The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.</p>
<p><strong>Stay (DC 15):</strong> The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.</p>
<p><strong>Track (DC 20):</strong> The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the scent ability)</p>
<p><strong>Work (DC 15):</strong> The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.</p>
<p><strong>Train an Animal for a Purpose:</strong> Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal's purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.</p>
<p>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time. </p>
<p><strong>Combat Riding (DC 20):</strong> An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also &quot;upgrade&quot; an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal's previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and riding dogs are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they don't require any additional training for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Fighting (DC 20):</strong> An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Guarding (DC 20):</strong> An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Labor (DC 15):</strong> An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Hunting (DC 20):</strong> An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes six weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Performance (DC 15):</strong> An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes five weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Riding (DC 15):</strong> An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Rear a Wild Animal:</strong> To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once.</p>
<p>A successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it's being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Handling an animal is a move action, while pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can handle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, except for rearing an animal.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can use this skill on a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks known as animals do.</p>
<p>A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal checks involving her animal companion.</p>
<p>In addition, a druid's or ranger's animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which don't count against the normal limit on tricks known and don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks to teach.</p>
<p>If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks and wild empathy checks.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you can't teach, rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no ranks in Handle Animal can use a Charisma check to handle and push her animal companion, but she can't teach, rear, or train other nondomestic animals.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>First Aid:</strong> You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them.</p>
<p><strong>Long-Term Care:</strong> Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to ability damage) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.</p>
<p>You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Treat Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones:</strong> A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at one-half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.</p>
<p>A creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim's injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.</p>
<p><strong>Treat Poison:</strong> To treat poison means to tend a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.</p>
<p><strong>Treat Disease:</strong> To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased character. Every time he or she makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell takes 10 minutes of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. Generally speaking, you can't try a Heal check again without proof of the original check's failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A character with the Self-Sufficient feat gets a +2 bonus on Heal checks.</p>
<p>A healer's kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hide-dex-armor-check-penalty"><a class="header" href="#hide-dex-armor-check-penalty">Hide (Dex; Armor Check Penalty)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Your Hide check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone who might see you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your normal speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging.</p>
<p>A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large -4, Huge -8, Gargantuan -12, Colossal -16.</p>
<p>You need cover or concealment in order to attempt a Hide check. Total cover or total concealment usually (but not always; see Special, below) obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can see you anyway.</p>
<p>If people are observing you, even casually, you can't hide. You can run around a corner or behind cover so that you're out of sight and then hide, but the others then know at least where you went.</p>
<p>If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check; see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in Hide.) This check, however, is made at a -10 penalty because you have to move fast.</p>
<p><strong>Sniping:</strong> If you've already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack, then immediately hide again. You take a -20 penalty on your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Diversion to Hide:</strong> You can use Bluff to help you hide. A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check as part of movement, so it doesn't take a separate action. However, hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if you're moving.</p>
<p>If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Hide checks.</p>
<p>A 13th-level ranger can attempt a Hide check in any sort of natural terrain, even if it doesn't grant cover or concealment. A 17thlevel ranger can do this even while being observed.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="skills-1"><a class="header" href="#skills-1">Skills</a></h1>
<p>If you buy a class skill, your character gets 1 rank (equal to a +1 bonus on checks with that skill) for each skill point. If you buy other classes' skills (cross-class skills), you get 1/2 rank per skill point.</p>
<p>Your maximum rank in a class skill is your character level + 3.</p>
<p>Your maximum rank in a cross-class skill is one-half of this number (do not round up or down).</p>
<p><strong>Using Skills:</strong> To make a skill check, roll: 1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier = skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)</p>
<p>This roll works just like an attack roll or a saving throw-- the higher the roll, the better. Either you're trying to match or exceed a certain Difficulty Class (DC), or you're trying to beat another character's check result.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Ranks:</strong> A character's number of ranks in a skill is based on how many skill points a character has invested in a skill. Many skills can be used even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making an untrained skill check.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Modifier:</strong> The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill's key ability (the ability associated with the skill's use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Modifiers:</strong> Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.</p>
<p>Each skill point you spend on a class skill gets you 1 rank in that skill. Class skills are the skills found on your character's class skill list. Each skill point you spend on a cross-class skill gets your character 1/2 rank in that skill. Cross-class skills are skills not found on your character's class skill list. (Half ranks do not improve your skill check, but two 1/2 ranks make 1 rank.) You can't save skill points to spend later.</p>
<p>The maximum rank in a class skill is the character's level + 3. If it's a cross-class skill, the maximum rank is half of that number (do not round up or down).</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a skill is purchased as a class skill or a cross-class skill, if it is a class skill for any of your classes, your maximum rank equals your total character level + 3.</p>
<h2 id="using-skills-1"><a class="header" href="#using-skills-1">Using Skills</a></h2>
<p>When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well he or she does. The higher the result of the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.</p>
<p>Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise he or she would fail.</p>
<h2 id="skill-checks-1"><a class="header" href="#skill-checks-1">Skill Checks</a></h2>
<p>A skill check takes into account a character's training (skill rank), natural talent (ability modifier), and luck (the die roll). It may also take into account his or her race's knack for doing certain things (racial bonus) or what armor he or she is wearing (armor check penalty), or a certain feat the character possesses, among other things. </p>
<p>To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character's skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the character's ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill's key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply, including racial bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.</p>
<h3 id="difficulty-class-1"><a class="header" href="#difficulty-class-1">Difficulty Class</a></h3>
<p>Some checks are made against a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC is a number (set using the skill rules as a guideline) that you must score as a result on your skill check in order to succeed.</p>

<p>An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character's check result.

<h3 id="trying-again-1"><a class="header" href="#trying-again-1">Trying Again</a></h3>
<p>In general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some skills, however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.</p>
<h3 id="untrained-skill-checks-1"><a class="header" href="#untrained-skill-checks-1">Untrained Skill Checks</a></h3>
<p>Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill he or she does not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The skill modifier doesn't have a skill rank added in because the character has no ranks in the skill. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the modifier for the skill's key ability, are applied to the check.</p>
<p>Many skills can be used only by someone who is trained in them.</p>
<h3 id="favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions-1"><a class="header" href="#favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions-1">Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions</a></h3>
<p>Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.</p>
<p>The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent conditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the skill user a -2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can be subpar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conditions that affect your character's ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check's DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.</p>
<h3 id="time-and-skill-checks-1"><a class="header" href="#time-and-skill-checks-1">Time and Skill Checks</a></h3>
<p>Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action.</p>
<p>These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.</p>
<h3 id="checks-without-rolls-1"><a class="header" href="#checks-without-rolls-1">Checks without Rolls</a></h3>
<p>A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.</p>
<p>Taking 10: When your character is not being threatened or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure --you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn't help.</p>
<p><strong>Taking 20:</strong> When you have plenty of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one standard action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no penalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, eventually you will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.</p>
<p>Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes twenty times as long as making a single check would take.</p>
<p>Since taking 20 assumes that the character will fail many times before succeeding, if you did attempt to take 20 on a skill that carries penalties for failure, your character would automatically incur those penalties before he or she could complete the task. Common &quot;take 20&quot; skills include Escape Artist, Open Lock, and Search.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Checks and Caster Level Checks:</strong> The normal take 10 and take 20 rules apply for ability checks. Neither rule applies to caster level checks.</p>
<h2 id="combining-skill-attempts-1"><a class="header" href="#combining-skill-attempts-1">Combining Skill Attempts</a></h2>
<p>When more than one character tries the same skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may overlap.</p>
<h3 id="individual-events-1"><a class="header" href="#individual-events-1">Individual Events</a></h3>
<p>Often, several characters attempt some action and each succeeds or fails independently.  The result of one character's Climb check does not influence the results of other characters Climb check.</p>
<h3 id="aid-another-1"><a class="header" href="#aid-another-1">Aid Another</a></h3>
<p>You can help another character achieve success on his or her skill check by making the same kind of skill check in a cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to his or her check, as per the rule for favorable conditions. (You can't take 10 on a skill check to aid another.) In many cases, a character's help won't be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once. </p>
<p>In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you can't aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn't achieve alone.</p>
<h2 id="skill-synergy-1"><a class="header" href="#skill-synergy-1">Skill Synergy</a></h2>
<p>It's possible for a character to have two skills that work well together. In general, having 5 or more ranks in one skill gives the character a +2 bonus on skill checks with each of its synergistic skills, as noted in the skill description. In some cases, this bonus applies only to specific uses of the skill in question, and not to all checks. Some skills provide benefits on other checks made by a character, such as those checks required to use certain class features.</p>
<h2 id="ability-checks-1"><a class="header" href="#ability-checks-1">Ability Checks</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes a character tries to do something to which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate ability modifier. Essentially, you're making an untrained skill check. </p>
<p>In some cases, an action is a straight test of one's ability with no luck involved. Just as you wouldn't make a height check to see who is taller, you don't make a Strength check to see who is stronger.</p>
<h2 id="skill-descriptions-1"><a class="header" href="#skill-descriptions-1">Skill Descriptions</a></h2>
<p>This section describes each skill, including common uses and typical modifiers. Characters can sometimes use skills for purposes other than those noted here.</p>
<p>Here is the format for skill descriptions.</p>
<h1 id="skill-name-1"><a class="header" href="#skill-name-1">SKILL NAME</a></h1>
<p>The skill name line includes (in addition to the name of the skill) the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Ability:</strong> The abbreviation of the ability whose modifier applies to the skill check. Exception: Speak Language has &quot;None&quot; as its key ability because the use of this skill does not require a check.</li>
<li><strong>Trained Only:</strong> If this notation is included in the skill name line, you must have at least 1 rank in the skill to use it. If it is omitted, the skill can be used untrained (with a rank of 0). If any special notes apply to trained or untrained use, they are covered in the Untrained section (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Armor Check Penalty:</strong> If this notation is included in the skill name line, an armor check penalty applies (when appropriate) to checks using this skill. If this entry is absent, an armor check penalty does not apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill name line is followed by a general description of what using the skill represents. After the description are a few other types of information:</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> What a character (&quot;you&quot; in the skill description) can do with a successful skill check and the check's DC.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> The type of action using the skill requires, or the amount of time required for a check.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Any conditions that apply to successive attempts to use the skill successfully. If the skill doesn't allow you to attempt the same task more than once, or if failure carries an inherent penalty (such as with the Climb skill), you can't take 20. If this paragraph is omitted, the skill can be retried without any inherent penalty, other than the additional time required.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Any extra facts that apply to the skill, such as special effects deriving from its use or bonuses that certain characters receive because of class, feat choices, or race.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> Some skills grant a bonus to the use of one or more other skills because of a synergistic effect. This entry, when present, indicates what bonuses this skill may grant or receive because of such synergies. See Table 4-5 for a complete list of bonuses granted by synergy between skills (or between a skill and a class feature).</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> The full utility of certain skills is restricted to characters of certain classes or characters who possess certain feats. This entry indicates whether any such restrictions exist for the skill.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> This entry indicates what a character without at least 1 rank in the skill can do with it. If this entry doesn't appear, it means that the skill functions normally for untrained characters (if it can be used untrained) or that an untrained character can't attempt checks with this skill (for skills that are designated as &quot;Trained Only&quot;).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="intimidate-cha"><a class="header" href="#intimidate-cha">Intimidate (Cha)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can change another's behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target's modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus [if any] + target's modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target's check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and for 1d6x10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target's default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile).</p>
<p>If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Demoralize Opponent:</strong> You can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent's resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate check opposed by the target's modified level check (see above). If you win, the target becomes shaken for 1 round. A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that can see you.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Changing another's behavior requires 1 minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a standard action.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn't help. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is futile.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are larger than your target. Conversely, you take a -4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are smaller than your target.</p>
<p>A character immune to fear can't be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent creatures.</p>
<p>If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="jump-str-armor-check-penalty"><a class="header" href="#jump-str-armor-check-penalty">Jump (Str; Armor Check Penalty)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below).</p>
<p>Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a -6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.</p>
<p>All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.</p>
<p>Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round.</p>
<p>If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.</p>
<p><strong>Long Jump:</strong> A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).</p>
<p>If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don't clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.</p>

<ol>
<li>Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>High Jump:</strong> A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high above or to grasp something overhead. The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared.</p>
<p>If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped. As with a long jump, the DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.</p>
<p>| High Jump Distance<sup>1</sup>  | | Jump DC<sup>2</sup> | |  |
| 1 foot  | | 4 | |  |
| 2 feet  | | 8 | |  |
| 3 feet  | | 12 | |  |

<ol>
<li>Not including vertical reach; see below.</li>
<li>Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to the size of the character or creature. The maximum vertical reach (height the creature can reach without jumping) for an average creature of a given size is shown on the table below. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.)</p>
<p>Quadrupedal creatures don't have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature; treat them as being one size category smaller.</p>

<p><strong>Hop Up:</strong> You can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.</p>
<p><strong>Jumping Down:</strong> If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.</p>
<p>If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> None. A Jump check is included in your movement, so it is part of a move action. If you run out of movement mid-jump, your next action (either on this turn or, if necessary, on your next turn) must be a move action to complete the jump.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Effects that increase your movement also increase your jumping distance, since your check is modified by your speed.</p>
<p>If you have the Run feat, you get a +4 bonus on Jump checks for any jumps made after a running start.</p>
<p>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Jump checks because halflings are agile and athletic.</p>
<p>If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="knowledge-int-trained-only"><a class="header" href="#knowledge-int-trained-only">Knowledge (Int; Trained Only)</a></h1>
<p>Like the Craft and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills. Knowledge represents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even scientific discipline.</p>
<p>Below are listed typical fields of study.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)</li>
<li>Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)</li>
<li>Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)</li>
<li>Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)</li>
<li>History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)</li>
<li>Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)</li>
<li>Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)</li>
<li>Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees, mottoes, personalities)</li>
<li>Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)</li>
<li>The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the planes)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).</p>
<p>In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster's HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster.</p>
<p>For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge check doesn't take an action--you simply know the answer or you don't.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn't let you know something that you never learned in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana), you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), you get a +2 bonus on Search checks made to find secret doors or hidden compartments.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), you get a +2 bonus on bardic knowledge checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (local), you get a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made in aboveground natural environments (aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, or plains).</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nobility and royalty), you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion), you get a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while underground.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> An untrained Knowledge check is simply an Intelligence check. Without actual training, you know only common knowledge (DC 10 or lower).</p>

<p>In the case of people trying to be quiet, the DCs given on the table could be replaced by Move Silently checks, in which case the indicated DC would be their average check result. </p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Every time you have a chance to hear something in a reactive manner (such as when someone makes a noise or you move into a new area), you can make a Listen check without using an action. Trying to hear something you failed to hear previously is a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. You can try to hear something that you failed to hear previously with no penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> When several characters are listening to the same thing, a single 1d20 roll can be used for all the individuals' Listen checks.</p>
<p>A fascinated creature takes a -4 penalty on Listen checks made as reactions.</p>

<p>A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks that involve its use.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening's work to a full day's performance. The bard's special Perform-based abilities are described in that class's description.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don't negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A bard must have at least 3 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire courage in his allies, or to use his countersong or his fascinate ability. A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire competence, 9 ranks to use his suggestion ability, 12 ranks to inspire greatness, 15 ranks to use his song of freedom ability, 18 ranks to inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his mass suggestion ability. See Bardic Music in the bard class description.</p>
<p>In addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain people with sleight of hand, tumbling, tightrope walking, and spells (especially illusions).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="profession-wis-trained-only"><a class="header" href="#profession-wis-trained-only">Profession (Wis; Trained Only)</a></h1>
<p>Like Craft, Knowledge, and Perform, Profession is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Profession skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill. While a Craft skill represents ability in creating or making an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. </p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your Profession check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the profession's daily tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how to handle common problems.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Not applicable. A single check generally represents a week of work.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill to earn an income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly wage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a week to determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt to accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> Untrained laborers and assistants (that is, characters without any ranks in Profession) earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ride-dex"><a class="header" href="#ride-dex">Ride (Dex)</a></h1>
<p>If you attempt to ride a creature that is ill suited as a mount, you take a -5 penalty on your Ride checks.</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Typical riding actions don't require checks. You can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount from a mount without a problem.</p>
<p>The following tasks do require checks.</p>

</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Armor check penalty applies.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Guide with Knees:</strong> You can react instantly to guide your mount with your knees so that you can use both hands in combat. Make your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand this round because you need to use the other to control your mount.</p>
<p><strong>Stay in Saddle:</strong> You can react instantly to try to avoid falling when your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when you take damage. This usage does not take an action.</p>
<p><strong>Fight with Warhorse:</strong> If you direct your war-trained mount to attack in battle, you can still make your own attack or attacks normally. This usage is a free action.</p>
<p><strong>Cover:</strong> You can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can't attack or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail your Ride check, you don't get the cover benefit. This usage does not take an action.</p>
<p><strong>Soft Fall:</strong> You can react instantly to try to take no damage when you fall off a mount--when it is killed or when it falls, for example. If you fail your Ride check, you take 1d6 points of falling damage. This usage does not take an action.</p>
<p><strong>Leap:</strong> You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its movement. Use your Ride modifier or the mount's Jump modifier, whichever is lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail your Ride check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an action, but is part of the mount's movement.</p>
<p><strong>Spur Mount:</strong> You can spur your mount to greater speed with a move action. A successful Ride check increases the mount's speed by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You can use this ability every round, but each consecutive round of additional speed deals twice as much damage to the mount as the previous round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).</p>
<p><strong>Control Mount in Battle:</strong> As a move action, you can attempt to control a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not trained for combat riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check, you can do nothing else in that round. You do not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Mount or Dismount:</strong> You can attempt to mount or dismount from a mount of up to one size category larger than yourself as a free action, provided that you still have a move action available that round. If you fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a move action. You can't use fast mount or dismount on a mount more than one size category larger than yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Mounting or dismounting normally is a move action. Other checks are a move action, a free action, or no action at all, as noted above.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you are riding bareback, you take a -5 penalty on Ride checks.</p>
<p>If your mount has a military saddle you get a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle.</p>
<p>The Ride skill is a prerequisite for the feats Mounted Archery, Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge, Trample.</p>
<p>If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="search-int"><a class="header" href="#search-int">Search (Int)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You generally must be within 10 feet of the object or surface to be searched. The table below gives DCs for typical tasks involving the Search skill.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Task</th><th align="center">Search DC</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Ransack a chest full of junk to find a certain item</td><td align="center">10</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Notice a typical secret door or a simple trap</td><td align="center">20</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Find a difficult nonmagical trap (rogue only)1</td><td align="center">21 or higher</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Notice a well-hidden secret door</td><td align="center">30</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Find a footprint</td><td align="center">Varies2</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Dwarves (even if they are not rogues) can use Search to find traps built into or out of stone.</li>
<li>A successful Search check can find a footprint or similar sign of a creature's passage, but it won't let you find or follow a trail. See the Track feat for the appropriate DC.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> It takes a full-round action to search a 5-foot-by-5-foot area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Search checks, and a half-elf has a +1 racial bonus. An elf (but not a half-elf) who simply passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door can make a Search check to find that door.</p>
<p>If you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Search checks.</p>
<p>The spells explosive runes, fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol, and teleportation circle create magic traps that a rogue can find by making a successful Search check and then can attempt to disarm by using Disable Device. Identifying the location of a snare spell has a DC of 23. Spike growth and spike stones create magic traps that can be found using Search, but against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.</p>
<p>Active abjuration spells within 10 feet of each other for 24 hours or more create barely visible energy fluctuations. These fluctuations give you a +4 bonus on Search checks to locate such abjuration spells.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find or follow tracks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), you get a +2 bonus on Search checks to find secret doors or hidden compartments.</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> While anyone can use Search to find a trap whose DC is 20 or lower, only a rogue can use Search to locate traps with higher DCs. (Exception: The spell find traps temporarily enables a cleric to use the Search skill as if he were a rogue.)</p>
<p>A dwarf, even one who is not a rogue, can use the Search skill to find a difficult trap (one with a DC higher than 20) if the trap is built into or out of stone. He gains a +2 racial bonus on the Search check from his stonecunning ability.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sense-motive-wis"><a class="header" href="#sense-motive-wis">Sense Motive (Wis)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> A successful check lets you avoid being bluffed (see the Bluff skill). You can also use this skill to determine when &quot;something is up&quot; (that is, something odd is going on) or to assess someone's trustworthiness. </p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Task</th><th align="center">Sense Motive DC</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Hunch</td><td align="center">20</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sense enchantment</td><td align="center">25 or 15</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Discern secret message</td><td align="center">Varies</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Hunch:</strong> This use of the skill involves making a gut assessment of the social situation. You can get the feeling from another's behavior that something is wrong, such as when you're talking to an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy.</p>
<p><strong>Sense Enchantment:</strong> You can tell that someone's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition, a mind-affecting effect), even if that person isn't aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see dominate person), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target's activities.</p>
<p><strong>Discern Secret Message:</strong> You may use Sense Motive to detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill. In this case, your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of the character transmitting the message. For each piece of information relating to the message that you are missing, you take a -2 penalty on your Sense Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that something hidden is being communicated, but you can't learn anything specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you don't detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you infer some false information.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Trying to gain information with Sense Motive generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening trying to get a sense of the people around you.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> No, though you may make a Sense Motive check for each Bluff check made against you.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A ranger gains a bonus on Sense Motive checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>
<p>If you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sleight-of-hand-dex-trained-only-armor-check-penalty"><a class="header" href="#sleight-of-hand-dex-trained-only-armor-check-penalty">Sleight Of Hand (Dex; Trained Only; Armor Check Penalty)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is determined to note where the item went.</p>
<p>When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer's Spot check. The observer's success doesn't prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.</p>
<p>You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone observing you or the Search check of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus on the Search check, since it's generally easier to find such an object than to hide it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light weapons, and grants you a +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it, and heavy or baggy clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.</p>
<p>Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to obtain it. The opponent makes a Spot check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand check result you achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether you got the item.</p>
<p>You can also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as though you were using the Perform skill. In such a case, your &quot;act&quot; encompasses elements of legerdemain, juggling, and the like.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Sleight of Hand DC</th><th align="left">Task</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">10</td><td align="left">Palm a coin-sized object, make a coin disappear</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">Lift a small object from a person</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Any Sleight of Hand check normally is a standard action. However, you may perform a Sleight of Hand check as a free action by taking a -20 penalty on the check.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, but after an initial failure, a second Sleight of Hand attempt against the same target (or while you are being watched by the same observer who noticed your previous attempt) increases the DC for the task by 10.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.</p>
<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> An untrained Sleight of Hand check is simply a Dexterity check. Without actual training, you can't succeed on any Sleight of Hand check with a DC higher than 10, except for hiding an object on your body.</p>

<li>You start at 1st level knowing one or two languages (based on your race), plus an additional number of languages equal to your starting Intelligence bonus.</li>
<li>You can purchase Speak Language just like any other skill, but instead of buying a rank in it, you choose a new language that you can speak.</li>
<li>You don't make Speak Language checks. You either know a language or you don't.</li>

<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can identify spells and magic effects. The DCs for Spellcraft checks relating to various tasks are summarized on the table above.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies, as noted above.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> See above.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you are a specialist wizard, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks when dealing with a spell or effect from your specialty school. You take a -5 penalty when dealing with a spell or effect from a prohibited school (and some tasks, such as learning a prohibited spell, are just impossible).</p>
<p>If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana), you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to decipher spells on scrolls.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain spells allow you to gain information about magic, provided that you make a successful Spellcraft check as detailed in the spell description.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="spot-wis"><a class="header" href="#spot-wis">Spot (Wis)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> The Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot check is opposed by the Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn't intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary to notice it.</p>
<p>A Spot check result higher than 20 generally lets you become aware of an invisible creature near you, though you can't actually see it.</p>
<p>Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the Disguise skill), and to read lips when you can't hear or understand what someone is saying.</p>
<p>Spot checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter begins. A penalty applies on such checks, depending on the distance between the two individuals or groups, and an additional penalty may apply if the character making the Spot check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Condition</th><th align="center">Penalty</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Per 10 feet of distance</td><td align="center">-1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Spotter distracted</td><td align="center">-5</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Read Lips:</strong> To understand what someone is saying by reading lips, you must be within 30 feet of the speaker, be able to see him or her speak, and understand the speaker's language. (This use of the skill is language-dependent.) The base DC is 15, but it increases for complex speech or an inarticulate speaker. You must maintain a line of sight to the lips being read.</p>
<p>If your Spot check succeeds, you can understand the general content of a minute's worth of speaking, but you usually still miss certain details. If the check fails by 4 or less, you can't read the speaker's lips. If the check fails by 5 or more, you draw some incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is rolled secretly in this case, so that you don't know whether you succeeded or missed by 5.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Every time you have a chance to spot something in a reactive manner you can make a Spot check without using an action. Trying to spot something you failed to see previously is a move action. To read lips, you must concentrate for a full minute before making a Spot check, and you can't perform any other action (other than moving at up to half speed) during this minute.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. You can try to spot something that you failed to see previously at no penalty. You can attempt to read lips once per minute.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fascinated creature takes a -4 penalty on Spot checks made as reactions.</p>
<p>If you have the Alertness feat, you get a +2 bonus on Spot checks.</p>
<p>A ranger gains a bonus on Spot checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>
<p>An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
<p>A half-elf has a +1 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
<p>The master of a hawk familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in daylight or other lighted areas.</p>
<p>The master of an owl familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in shadowy or other darkened areas.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="survival-wis"><a class="header" href="#survival-wis">Survival (Wis)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild. The table below gives the DCs for various tasks that require Survival checks.</p>
<p>Survival does not allow you to follow difficult tracks unless you are a ranger or have the Track feat (see the Restriction section below).</p>

<tr><td align="center">10</td><td align="left">Get along in the wild. Move up to one-half your overland speed while hunting and foraging (no food or water supplies needed). You can provide food and water for one other person for every 2 points by which your check result exceeds 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">15</td><td align="left">Gain a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves against severe weather while moving up to one-half your overland speed, or gain a +4 bonus if you remain stationary.

<tr><td align="center">15</td><td align="left">Keep from getting lost or avoid natural hazards, such as quicksand.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">15</td><td align="left">Predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. For every 5 points by which your Survival check result exceeds 15, you can predict the weather for one additional day in advance.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Varies</td><td align="left">Follow tracks (see the Track feat).</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. A single Survival check may represent activity over the course of hours or a full day. A Survival check made to find tracks is at least a full-round action, and it may take even longer.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. For getting along in the wild or for gaining the Fortitude save bonus noted in the table above, you make a Survival check once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies until the next check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural hazards, you make a Survival check whenever the situation calls for one. Retries to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid a specific natural hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes(indoors) of searching.</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> While anyone can use Survival to find tracks (regardless of the DC), or to follow tracks when the DC for the task is 10 or lower, only a ranger (or a character with the Track feat) can use Survival to follow tracks when the task has a higher DC.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you can automatically determine where true north lies in relation to yourself.</p>
<p>A ranger gains a bonus on Survival checks when using this skill to find or follow the tracks of a favored enemy.</p>
<p>If you have the Self-Sufficient feat, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while underground.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks in aboveground natural environments (aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, and plains).</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find or follow tracks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="swim-str-armor-check-penalty"><a class="header" href="#swim-str-armor-check-penalty">Swim (Str; Armor Check Penalty)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to one-half your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-quarter your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.</p>
<p>If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check, you begin to drown.</p>
<p>The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table below.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Water</th><th>Swim DC</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Calm water</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Rough water</td><td>15</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Stormy water</td><td>20<sup>1</sup></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>You can't take 10 on a Swim check in stormy water, even if you aren't otherwise being threatened or distracted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> A successful Swim check allows you to swim one-quarter of your speed as a move action or one-half your speed as a full-round action.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Swim checks are subject to double the normal armor check penalty and encumbrance penalty.</p>
<p>If you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Swim checks.</p>
<p>If you have the Endurance feat, you get a +4 bonus on Swim checks made to avoid taking nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>
<p>A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its indicated speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The creature always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered when swimming. Such a creature can use the run action while swimming, provided that it swims in a straight line.</p>

<p>You can't use this skill if your speed has been reduced by armor, excess equipment, or loot.</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can land softly when you fall or tumble past opponents. You can also tumble to entertain an audience (as though using the Perform skill). The DCs for various tasks involving the Tumble skill are given on the table below.</p>

Failure means you provoke attacks of opportunity normally. Check separately for each opponent you move past, in the order in which you pass them (player's choice of order in case of a tie). Each additional enemy after the first adds +2 to the Tumble DC.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">25</td><td align="left">Tumble at one-half speed through an area occupied by an enemy (over, under, or around the opponent) as part of normal movement, provoking no attacks of opportunity while doing so.

Each additional enemy after the first adds +2 to the Tumble DC.</td></tr>

<p>Obstructed or otherwise treacherous surfaces, such as natural cavern floors or undergrowth, are tough to tumble through. The DC for any Tumble check made to tumble into such a square is modified as indicated below.</p>

<li>Tumbling is impossible in a deep bog.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Accelerated Tumbling:</strong> You try to tumble past or through enemies more quickly than normal. By accepting a -10 penalty on your Tumble checks, you can move at your full speed instead of one-half your speed.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Not applicable. Tumbling is part of movement, so a Tumble check is part of a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Usually no. An audience, once it has judged a tumbler as an uninteresting performer, is not receptive to repeat performances.</p>
<p>You can try to reduce damage from a fall as an instant reaction only once per fall.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2 dodge bonus to AC.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +6 dodge bonus to AC when executing the total defense standard action instead of the usual +4 dodge bonus to AC.</p>
<p>If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.</p>

<p>Use this skill to activate magic</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you were a different race, or as if you were of a different alignment.</p>
<p>You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand. If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.</p>
<p>You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for that purpose. The DCs for various tasks involving Use Magic Device checks are summarized on the table below.</p>

<p><strong>Activate Blindly:</strong> Some magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you're not and even if you don't know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you've activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can't activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but it doesn't do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Decipher a Written Spell:</strong> This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Emulate an Ability Score:</strong> To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you're emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don't need to make this check.</p>
<p><strong>Emulate an Alignment:</strong> Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user's alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Emulate a Class Feature:</strong> Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20.  This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).</p>
<p><strong>Emulate a Race:</strong> Some magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Use a Scroll:</strong> If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll's spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don't have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).</p>
<p>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items.</p>
<p><strong>Use a Wand:</strong> Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand's spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill also applies to other spell trigger magic items, such as staffs.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.</p>
<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can't try to activate that item again for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You cannot take 10 with this skill.</p>
<p>You can't aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the item may attempt such a check.</p>
<p>If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus to Spellcraft checks made to decipher spells on scrolls.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="use-rope-dex"><a class="header" href="#use-rope-dex">Use Rope (Dex)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Most tasks with a rope are relatively simple. The DCs for various tasks utilizing this skill are summarized on the table below.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Use Rope DC</th><th>Task</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">10</td><td>Tie a firm knot</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">10<sup>1</sup></td><td>Secure a grappling hook</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">15</td><td>Tie a special knot, such as one that slips, slides slowly, or loosens with a tug</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">15</td><td>Tie a rope around yourself one-handed</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">15</td><td>Splice two ropes together</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Varies</td><td>Bind a character</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Add 2 to the DC for every 10 feet the hook is thrown; see below.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Secure a Grappling Hook:</strong> Securing a grappling hook requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet of distance the grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting weight. This check is made secretly, so that you don't know whether the rope will hold your weight.</p>
<p><strong>Bind a Character:</strong> When you bind another character with a rope, any Escape Artist check that the bound character makes is opposed by your Use Rope check.</p>
<p>You get a +10 bonus on this check because it is easier to bind someone than to escape from bonds. You don't even make your Use Rope check until someone tries to escape.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Tying a knot, tying a special knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two ropes together takes 5 minutes. Binding a character takes 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A silk rope gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Rope checks. If you cast an animate rope spell on a rope, you get a +2 circumstance bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using that rope.</p>
<p>These bonuses stack.</p>
<p>If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks.</p>
<p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks when escaping from rope bonds.</p>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2 bonus on checks made to bind someone.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="feats"><a class="header" href="#feats">Feats</a></h1>
<h2 id="prerequisites"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill, base attack bonus, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.</p>
<p>A character can't use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-feats"><a class="header" href="#types-of-feats">Types Of Feats</a></h2>
<p>Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are item creation feats, which allow spellcasters to create magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and cast a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell were a higher spell level than it actually is.</p>
<h3 id="fighter-bonus-feats"><a class="header" href="#fighter-bonus-feats">Fighter Bonus Feats</a></h3>
<p>Any feat designated as a fighter feat can be selected as a fighter's bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming that they meet any prerequisites.</p>
<h3 id="item-creation-feats"><a class="header" href="#item-creation-feats">Item Creation Feats</a></h3>
<p>An item creation feat lets a spellcaster create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.</p>
<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> Experience that the spellcaster would normally keep is expended when making a magic item. The XP cost equals 1/25 of the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.</p>
<p><strong>Raw Materials Cost:</strong> The cost of creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the item.</p>
<p>Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.</p>
<p><strong>Item Cost:</strong> Brew Potion, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of these items depends on their caster level--that is, a spell from such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price of these items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be high enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scrolls:</strong> Base price = spell level x caster level x 25 gp.</li>
<li><strong>Potions:</strong> Base price = spell level x caster level x 50 gp.</li>
<li><strong>Wands:</strong> Base price = spell level x caster level x 750 gp.</li>
</ul>
<p>A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Costs:</strong> Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component or pay the XP cost when creating the item.</p>
<p>For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.</p>
<p>Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
<h3 id="metamagic-feats"><a class="header" href="#metamagic-feats">Metamagic Feats</a></h3>
<p>As a spellcaster's knowledge of magic grows, she can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the ways in which the spells were originally designed or learned. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, at least it is possible.  Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it does not go up.</p>
<p>Wizards and Divine Spellcasters: Wizards and divine spellcasters must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation, the character chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and thus which ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).</p>
<p>Sorcerers and Bards: Sorcerers and bards choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. But because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell's normal casting time is 1 action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn't the same as a 1-round casting time.)</p>
<p>For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.</p>
<p>Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats: A cleric spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell can cast a metamagic version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a 1-action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast.</p>
<p>Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell: In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared and cast as a higher-level spell. Saving throw modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description.</p>
<p>The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can't use a metamagic feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.</p>
<p>Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don't eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened. However, casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can't modify.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell:</strong> A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can't apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Items and Metamagic Spells:</strong> With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell's higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn't need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.</p>
<p><strong>Counterspelling Metamagic Spells:</strong> Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell.</p>

<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> In melee, every time you miss because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit.</p>
<p>An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however.</p>
<p>You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general reduces your speed to three-quarters normal, instead of one-half.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility also applies.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> The Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a blink spell.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Character level 6th.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Having this feat enables the character to attract loyal companions and devoted followers, subordinates who assist her. See the table below for what sort of cohort and how many followers the character can recruit.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Modifiers:</strong> Several factors can affect a character's Leadership score, causing it to vary from the base score (character level + Cha modifier). A character's reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower he is trying to attract) raises or lowers his Leadership score:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Leader's Reputation</th><th align="center">Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Great renown</td><td align="center">+2</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Fairness and generosity</td><td align="center">+1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Special power</td><td align="center">+1</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Aloofness</td><td align="center">-1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Cruelty</td><td align="center">-2</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Other modifiers may apply when the character tries to attract a cohort:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">The Leader...</th><th align="center">Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Has a familiar, special mount, or animal companion</td><td align="center">-2</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Recruits a cohort of a different alignment</td><td align="center">-1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Caused the death of a cohort</td><td align="center">-2<sup>*</sup></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>* Cumulative per cohort killed.</p>
<p>Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When the character tries to attract a new follower, use any of the following modifiers that apply.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">The Leader...</th><th>Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Has a stronghold, base of operations, guildhouse, or the like</td><td>+2</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Moves around a lot</td><td>-1</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Leadership Score:</strong> A character's base Leadership score equals his level plus any Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but the character must still be 6th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect a character's Leadership score, as detailed above.</p>
<p><strong>Cohort Level:</strong> The character can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of a character's Leadership score, he can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than himself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and alignment. The cohort's alignment may not be opposed to the leader's alignment on either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis, and the leader takes a Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of an alignment different from his own.</p>
<p>Cohorts earn XP as follows:</p>
<p>The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party's XP.</p>
<p>Divide the cohort's level by the level of the PC with whom he or she is associated (the character with the Leadership feat who attracted the cohort).</p>
<p>Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the cohort's total.</p>
<p>If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than the associated PC's character level, the cohort does not gain the new level--its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next level. </p>
<p><strong>Number of Followers by Level:</strong> The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they're generally low-level NPCs. Because they're generally five or more levels behind the character they follow, they're rarely effective in combat.</p>
<p>Followers don't earn experience and thus don't gain levels. However, when a character with Leadership attains a new level, the player consults the table above to determine if she has acquired more followers, some of which may be higher level than the existing followers. (You don't consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.)</p>
<h3 id="lightning-reflexes-general"><a class="header" href="#lightning-reflexes-general">Lightning Reflexes [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving throws.</p>
<h3 id="magical-aptitude-general"><a class="header" href="#magical-aptitude-general">Magical Aptitude [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Spellcraft checks and Use Magic Device checks.</p>
<h3 id="manyshot-general"><a class="header" href="#manyshot-general">Manyshot [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 17, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a standard action, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet. Both arrows use the same attack roll (with a -4 penalty) to determine success and deal damage normally (but see Special).</p>
<p>For every five points of base attack bonus you have above +6, you may add one additional arrow to this attack, to a maximum of four arrows at a base attack bonus of +16. However, each arrow after the second adds a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll (for a total penalty of -6 for three arrows and -8 for four).</p>
<p>Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Regardless of the number of arrows you fire, you apply precision-based damage only once. If you score a critical hit, only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal regular damage.</p>
<p>A fighter may select Manyshot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<p>A 6th-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Manyshot even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.</p>
<h3 id="martial-weapon-proficiency-general"><a class="header" href="#martial-weapon-proficiency-general">Martial Weapon Proficiency [General]</a></h3>
<p>Choose a type of martial weapon. You understand how to use that type of martial weapon in combat.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You make attack rolls with the selected weapon normally.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all martial weapons. They need not select this feat.</p>
<p>You can gain Martial Weapon Proficiency multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon. </p>
<p>A cleric who chooses the War domain automatically gains the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat related to his deity's favored weapon as a bonus feat, if the weapon is a martial one. He need not select it.</p>
<h3 id="maximize-spell-metamagic"><a class="header" href="#maximize-spell-metamagic">Maximize Spell [Metamagic]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.</p>
<p>An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result.</p>
<h3 id="mobility-general"><a class="header" href="#mobility-general">Mobility [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, Dodge.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a threatened area. A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.</p>
<p>Dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Mobility as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="mounted-archery-general"><a class="header" href="#mounted-archery-general">Mounted Archery [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The penalty you take when using a ranged weapon while mounted is halved: -2 instead of -4 if your mount is taking a double move, and -4 instead of -8 if your mount is running.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Mounted Archery as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="mounted-combat-general"><a class="header" href="#mounted-combat-general">Mounted Combat [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Ride 1 rank.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as a reaction) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent's attack roll. (Essentially, the Ride check result becomes the mount's Armor Class if it's higher than the mount's regular AC.)</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Mounted Combat as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="natural-spell-general"><a class="header" href="#natural-spell-general">Natural Spell [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wis 13, wild shape ability.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can complete the verbal and somatic components of spells while in a wild shape. You substitute various noises and gestures for the normal verbal and somatic components of a spell.</p>
<p>You can also use any material components or focuses you possess, even if such items are melded within your current form. This feat does not permit the use of magic items while you are in a form that could not ordinarily use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak while in a wild shape.</p>
<h3 id="negotiator-general"><a class="header" href="#negotiator-general">Negotiator [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy checks and Sense Motive checks.</p>
<h3 id="nimble-fingers-general"><a class="header" href="#nimble-fingers-general">Nimble Fingers [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Disable Device checks and Open Lock checks.</p>
<h3 id="persuasive-general"><a class="header" href="#persuasive-general">Persuasive [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Bluff checks and Intimidate checks.</p>
<h3 id="point-blank-shot-general"><a class="header" href="#point-blank-shot-general">Point Blank Shot [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Point Blank Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="power-attack-general"><a class="header" href="#power-attack-general">Power Attack [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Str 13.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> On your action, before making attack rolls for a round, you may choose to subtract a number from all melee attack rolls and add the same number to all melee damage rolls. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage apply until your next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands, instead add twice the number subtracted from your attack rolls. You can't add the bonus from Power Attack to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with unarmed strikes or natural weapon attacks), even though the penalty on attack rolls still applies. (Normally, you treat a double weapon as a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a double weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of it in a round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.)</p>
<p>A fighter may select Power Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="precise-shot-general"><a class="header" href="#precise-shot-general">Precise Shot [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Point Blank Shot.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard -4 penalty on your attack roll.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Precise Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="quick-draw-general"><a class="header" href="#quick-draw-general">Quick Draw [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Base attack bonus +1.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You can draw a hidden weapon (see the Sleight of Hand skill) as a move action.</p>
<p>A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow).</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Quick Draw as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="quicken-spell-metamagic"><a class="header" href="#quicken-spell-metamagic">Quicken Spell [Metamagic]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Casting a quickened spell is a free action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. You may cast only one quickened spell per round. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 full round action cannot be quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat can't be applied to any spell cast spontaneously (including sorcerer spells, bard spells, and cleric or druid spells cast spontaneously), since applying a metamagic feat to a spontaneously cast spell automatically increases the casting time to a full-round action.</p>
<h3 id="rapid-reload-general"><a class="header" href="#rapid-reload-general">Rapid Reload [General]</a></h3>
<p>Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy).</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow. </p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.</p>
<p>A fighter may select Rapid Reload as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="rapid-shot-general"><a class="header" href="#rapid-shot-general">Rapid Shot [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, Point Blank Shot.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can get one extra attack per round with a ranged weapon. The attack is at your highest base attack bonus, but each attack you make in that round (the extra one and the normal ones) takes a -2 penalty. You must use the full attack action to use this feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Rapid Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<p>A 2nd-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Rapid Shot, even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.</p>
<h3 id="ride-by-attack-general"><a class="header" href="#ride-by-attack-general">Ride-By Attack [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may move and attack as if with a standard charge and then move again (continuing the straight line of the charge). Your total movement for the round can't exceed double your mounted speed. You and your mount do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the opponent that you attack.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Ride-By Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
<h3 id="run-general"><a class="header" href="#run-general">Run [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When running, you move five times your normal speed (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If you make a jump after a running start (see the Jump skill description), you gain a +4 bonus on your Jump check. While running, you retain your Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> You move four times your speed while running (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or three times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load), and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
<h3 id="scribe-scroll-item-creation"><a class="header" href="#scribe-scroll-item-creation">Scribe Scroll [Item Creation]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Caster level 1st.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can create a scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a scroll is its spell level x ?its caster level x ?25 gp. To scribe a scroll, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.</p>
<p>Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when scribing the scroll.</p>
<h3 id="self-sufficient-general"><a class="header" href="#self-sufficient-general">Self-Sufficient [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Heal checks and Survival checks.</p>
<h3 id="shield-proficiency-general"><a class="header" href="#shield-proficiency-general">Shield Proficiency [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can use a shield and take only the standard penalties.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> When you are using a shield with which you are not proficient, you take the shield's armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all skill checks that involve moving, including Ride checks.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Barbarians, bards, clerics, druids, fighters, paladins, and rangers automatically have Shield Proficiency as a bonus feat. They need not select it.</p>
<h3 id="shot-on-the-run-general"><a class="header" href="#shot-on-the-run-general">Shot On The Run [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, base attack bonus +4.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using the attack action with a ranged weapon, you can move both before and after the attack, provided that your total distance moved is not greater than your speed.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Shot on the Run as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your next action). A stunned character can't act, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a -2 penalty to AC. You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be stunned.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A monk may select Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

<p><strong>Special:</strong> Fighters automatically have Tower Shield Proficiency as a bonus feat. They need not select it.</p>
<h3 id="track-general"><a class="header" href="#track-general">Track [General]</a></h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow.</p>
<p>You move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed with a -5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed with a -20 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions, as given on the table below:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Surface</th><th align="center">Survival DC</th><th align="left">Surface Survival</th><th align="center">DC</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<tr><td align="left">Soft ground</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="left">Hard ground</td><td align="center">20</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Very Soft Ground:</strong> Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints.</p>
<p><strong>Soft Ground:</strong> Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints.</p>
<p><strong>Firm Ground:</strong> Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.</p>
<p><strong>Hard Ground:</strong> Any surface that doesn't hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles). </p>
<p>Several modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the table below.</p>

<p>If you fail a Survival check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, you can use the Survival skill to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or lower.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="weapons"><a class="header" href="#weapons">Weapons</a></h1>
<h2 id="weapon-categories"><a class="header" href="#weapon-categories">Weapon Categories</a></h2>
<p>Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories.</p>
<p>These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon's use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon's usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small, Medium, or Large).</p>
<p>Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons: Anybody but a druid, monk, rogue, or wizard is proficient with all simple weapons. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all simple and all martial weapons. Characters of other classes are proficient with an assortment of mainly simple weapons and possibly also some martial or even exotic weapons. A character who uses a weapon with which he or she is not proficient takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
<p>Melee and Ranged Weapons: Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.</p>
<p>Reach Weapons: Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, spiked chains, and whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren't adjacent to him or her. Most reach double the wielder's natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.</p>
<p>Double Weapons: Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaffs, and two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two weapons, but he or she incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.</p>
<p>The character can also choose to use a double weapon two handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double weapon in one hand can't use it as a double weapon--only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p>Thrown Weapons: Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his or her Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn't designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn't have a numeric entry in the Range Increment column on Table: Weapons), but a character who does so takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.</p>
<p>Projectile Weapons: Light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no Strength bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it's a specially built composite shortbow, specially built composite longbow, or sling. If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he or she uses a bow or a sling.</p>
<p>Ammunition: Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), or sling bullets (for slings). When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading. Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while normal ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.</p>
<p>Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons), and what happens to them after they are thrown.</p>
<p>Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons: This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon's size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.</p>
<p>Light: A light weapon is easier to use in one's off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and it can be used while grappling. A light weapon is used in one hand. Add the wielder's Strength bonus (if any) to damage rolls for melee attacks with a light weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or one-half the wielder's Strength bonus if it's used in the off hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on damage; the Strength bonus applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder's primary hand only.</p>
<p>An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.</p>
<p>One-Handed: A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder's Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or 1/2 his or her Strength bonus if it's used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the character's Strength bonus to damage rolls.</p>
<p>Two-Handed: Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character's Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon. </p>
<p>Weapon Size: Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.</p>
<p>A weapon's size category isn't the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon's size category is keyed to the size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.</p>
<p>Inappropriately Sized Weapons: A creature can't make optimum use of a weapon that isn't properly sized for it. A cumulative -2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn't proficient with the weapon a -4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.</p>
<p>The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder's size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. If a weapon's designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can't wield the weapon at all.</p>
<p>Improvised Weapons: Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses one in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-qualities"><a class="header" href="#weapon-qualities">Weapon Qualities</a></h2>
<p>Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on Table: Weapons, below).</p>
<p>Cost: This value is the weapon's cost in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp). The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon.</p>
<p>This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.</p>
<p>Damage: The Damage columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. The column labeled &quot;Dmg (S)&quot; is for Small weapons. The column labeled &quot;Dmg (M)&quot; is for Medium weapons. If two damage ranges are given then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given for the double weapon's extra attack. Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage gives weapon damage values for weapons of those sizes.</p>
<p>| Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage | |  |
| Medium Weapon Damage | Tiny Weapon Damage | Large Weapon Damage | |  |
| 1d2 | -- | 1d3 | |  |

| 2d10 | 2d6 | 4d8 | |  |</p>
<p>Critical: The entry in this column notes how the weapon is used with the rules for critical hits. When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by its critical multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results together.</p>
<p>Exception: Extra damage over and above a weapon's normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.</p>
<p>x2: The weapon deals double damage on a critical hit.</p>
<p>x3: The weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit.</p>
<p>x3/x4: One head of this double weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit. The other head deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.</p>
<p>x4: The weapon deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.</p>
<p>19-20/x2: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. (The weapon has a threat range of 19-20.)</p>
<p>18-20/x2: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 18, 19, or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. (The weapon has a threat range of 18-20.)</p>
<p>Range Increment: Any attack at less than this distance is not penalized for range. However, each full range increment imposes a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot out to ten range increments.</p>
<p>Weight: This column gives the weight of a Medium version of the weapon. Halve this number for Small weapons and double it for Large weapons.</p>
<p>Type: Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.</p>
<p>Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of two types, the damage it deals is not half one type and half another; all of it is both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.</p>
<p>In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation when the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.</p>
<p>Special: Some weapons have special features. See the weapon descriptions for details.</p>

<p>Weapons found on Table: Weapons that have special options for the wielder (&quot;you&quot;) are described below. Splash weapons are described under Special Substances and Items.</p>
<p>Arrows: An arrow used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier x2). Arrows come in a leather quiver that holds 20 arrows. An arrow that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.</p>
<p>Axe, Orc Double: An orc double axe is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.</p>
<p>A creature wielding an orc double axe in one hand can't use it as a double weapon--only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p>Bolas: You can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a set of bolas.</p>
<p>Bolts: A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (crit x2). Bolts come in a wooden case that holds 10 bolts (or 5, for a repeating crossbow). A bolt that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.</p>
<p>Bullets, Sling: Bullets come in a leather pouch that holds 10 bullets. A bullet that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.</p>
<p>Chain, Spiked: A spiked chain has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, it can be used against an adjacent foe.</p>
<p>You can make trip attacks with the chain. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the chain to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>When using a spiked chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).</p>
<p>You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you.</p>
<p>Crossbow, Hand: You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.</p>
<p>Crossbow, Heavy: You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a -4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.</p>
<p>Crossbow, Light: You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a -2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.</p>
<p>Crossbow, Repeating: The repeating crossbow (whether heavy or light) holds 5 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts.</p>
<p>Dagger: You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a dagger on your body (see the Sleight of Hand skill).</p>
<p>Flail, Dire: A dire flail is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a dire flail in one hand can't use it as a double weapon-- only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p>When using a dire flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the opposed attack roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).</p>
<p>You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the dire flail to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>Flail or Heavy Flail: With a flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).</p>
<p>You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the flail to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>Gauntlet: This metal glove lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy armors (except breastplate) come with gauntlets.</p>
<p>Gauntlet, Spiked: Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of spiked gauntlets. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. An attack with a spiked gauntlet is considered an armed attack.</p>
<p>Glaive: A glaive has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.</p>
<p>Guisarme: A guisarme has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.</p>
<p>You can also use it to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the guisarme to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>Halberd: If you use a ready action to set a halberd against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.</p>
<p>You can use a halberd to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the halberd to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>Hammer, Gnome Hooked: A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. The hammer's blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (crit x3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (crit x4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other head is the offhand weapon. A creature wielding a gnome hooked hammer in one hand can't use it as a double weapon--only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p>You can use a gnome hooked hammer to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the gnome hooked hammer to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>Gnomes treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons.</p>
<p>Javelin: Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as nonproficient with it and take a -4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon.</p>
<p>Kama: The kama is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a kama special options.</p>
<p>You can use a kama to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the kama to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>Lance: A lance deals double damage when used from the back of a charging mount. It has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.</p>
<p>While mounted, you can wield a lance with one hand.</p>
<p>Longbow: You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. A longbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a longbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow (see below) but not a regular longbow.</p>
<p>Longbow, Composite: You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.</p>
<p>For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.</p>
<p>Longspear: A longspear has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe. If you use a ready action to set a longspear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.</p>
<p>Net: A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net's maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty on Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a DC 15 Concentration check or be unable to cast the spell.</p>
<p>An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action).</p>
<p>A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.</p>
<p>A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so.</p>
<p>Nunchaku: The nunchaku is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a nunchaku special options. With a nunchaku, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).</p>
<p>Quarterstaff: A quarterstaff is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a quarterstaff in one hand can't use it as a double weapon--only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p>The quarterstaff is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a quarterstaff special options.</p>
<p>Ranseur: A ranseur has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.</p>
<p>With a ranseur, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).</p>
<p>Rapier: You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a rapier sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you. You can't wield a rapier in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus to damage.</p>
<p>Sai: With a sai, you get a +4 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).</p>
<p>The sai is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a sai special options.</p>
<p>Scythe: A scythe can be used to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the scythe to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>Shield, Heavy or Light: You can bash with a shield instead of using it for defense. See Armor for details.</p>
<p>Shortbow: You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a shortbow while mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a shortbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow (see below) but not a regular shortbow.</p>
<p>Shortbow, Composite: You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite shortbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is lower than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite shortbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost. </p>
<p>For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.</p>
<p>Shortspear: A shortspear is small enough to wield one-handed. It may also be thrown.</p>
<p>Shuriken: A shuriken is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding shuriken special options. A shuriken can't be used as a melee weapon.</p>
<p>Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them and what happens to them after they are thrown.</p>
<p>Siangham: The siangham is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a siangham special options.</p>
<p>Sickle: A sickle can be used to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the sickle to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>Sling: Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
<p>Spear: A spear can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a spear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.</p>
<p>Spiked Armor: You can outfit your armor with spikes, which can deal damage in a grapple or as a separate attack. See Armor for details.</p>
<p>Spiked Shield, Heavy or Light: You can bash with a spiked shield instead of using it for defense. See Armor for details.</p>
<p>Strike, Unarmed: A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at her option. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.</p>
<p>An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike.</p>
<p>Sword, Bastard: A bastard sword is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A character can use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.</p>
<p>Sword, Two-Bladed: A two-bladed sword is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a two-bladed sword in one hand can't use it as a double weapon--only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p>Trident: This weapon can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a trident against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.</p>
<p>Urgrosh, Dwarven: A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. The urgrosh's axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other is the off-hand weapon. A creature wielding a dwarven urgrosh in one hand can't use it as a double weapon--only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p>If you use a ready action to set an urgrosh against a charge, you deal double damage if you score a hit against a charging character. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon that deals damage.</p>
<p>Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.</p>
<p>Waraxe, Dwarven: A dwarven waraxe is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a dwarven waraxe two-handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. A dwarf treats a dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even when using it in one hand.</p>
<p>Whip: A whip deals nonlethal damage. It deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don't threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).</p>
<p>Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.</p>
<p>You can make trip attacks with a whip. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the whip to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed if the attack fails).</p>
<p>You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you.</p>
<h2 id="masterwork-weapons"><a class="header" href="#masterwork-weapons">Masterwork Weapons</a></h2>
<p>A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.</p>
<p>You can't add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon (see the Craft skill). The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to the cost of a single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork quality to a double weapon costs twice the normal increase (+600 gp).</p>
<p>Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. The enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.</p>
<p>All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality. The enhancement bonus granted by the masterwork quality doesn't stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon's magic.</p>
<p>Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can't create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and shields have lessened armor check penalties.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="armor"><a class="header" href="#armor">Armor</a></h1>
<h2 id="armor-qualities"><a class="header" href="#armor-qualities">Armor Qualities</a></h2>
<p>To wear heavier armor effectively, a character can select the Armor Proficiency feats, but most classes are automatically proficient with the armors that work best for them.</p>
<p>Armor and shields can take damage from some types of attacks. </p>
<p>Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on Table: Armor and Shields, below).</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> The cost of the armor for Small or Medium humanoid creatures. See Armor for Unusual Creatures, below, for armor prices for other creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Armor/Shield Bonus:</strong> Each armor grants an armor bonus to AC, while shields grant a shield bonus to AC. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn't stack with other effects or items that grant an armor bonus. Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn't stack with other effects that grant a shield bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Dex Bonus:</strong> This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC that this type of armor allows. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer's ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn't affect any other Dexterity-related abilities.</p>
<p>Even if a character's Dexterity bonus to AC drops to 0 because of armor, this situation does not count as losing a Dexterity bonus to AC. </p>
<p>Your character's encumbrance (the amount of gear he or she carries) may also restrict the maximum Dexterity bonus that can be applied to his or her Armor Class.</p>
<p><strong>Shields:</strong> Shields do not affect a character's maximum Dexterity bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Check Penalty:</strong> Any armor heavier than leather hurts a character's ability to use some skills. An armor check penalty number is the penalty that applies to Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble checks by a character wearing a certain kind of armor. Double the normal armor check penalty is applied to Swim checks. A character's encumbrance (the amount of gear carried, including armor) may also apply an armor check penalty.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shields:</strong> If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both armor check penalties apply.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nonproficient with Armor Worn:</strong> A character who wears armor and/or uses a shield with which he or she is not proficient takes the armor's (and/or shield's) armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all Strength-based and Dexterity-based ability and skill checks. The penalty for nonproficiency with armor stacks with the penalty for nonproficiency with shields.</p>
<p><strong>Sleeping in Armor:</strong> A character who sleeps in medium or heavy armor is automatically fatigued the next day. He or she takes a -2 penalty on Strength and Dexterity and can't charge or run. Sleeping in light armor does not cause fatigue.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane Spell Failure:</strong> Armor interferes with the gestures that a spellcaster must make to cast an arcane spell that has a somatic component. Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell failure if they're wearing armor. Bards can wear light armor without incurring any arcane spell failure chance for their bard spells.</p>
<p><strong>Casting an Arcane Spell in Armor:</strong> A character who casts an arcane spell while wearing armor must usually make an arcane spell failure roll. The number in the Arcane Spell Failure Chance column on Table: Armor and Shields is the chance that the spell fails and is ruined. If the spell lacks a somatic component, however, it can be cast with no chance of arcane spell failure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shields:</strong> If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, add the two numbers together to get a single arcane spell failure chance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Speed:</strong> Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. The number on Table: Armor and Shields is the character's speed while wearing the armor. Humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs have an unencumbered speed of 30 feet. They use the first column. Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have an unencumbered speed of 20 feet. They use the second column. Remember, however, that a dwarf 's land speed remains 20 feet even in medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shields:</strong> Shields do not affect a character's speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> This column gives the weight of the armor sized for a Medium wearer. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor for Large characters weighs twice as much.</p>

<h2 id="armor-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#armor-descriptions">Armor Descriptions</a></h2>
<p>Any special benefits or accessories to the types of armor found on Table: Armor and Shields are described below.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Spikes:</strong> You can have spikes added to your armor, which allow you to deal extra piercing damage (see Table: Weapons) on a successful grapple attack. The spikes count as a martial weapon. If you are not proficient with them, you take a -4 penalty on grapple checks when you try to use them. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. (You can't also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.)</p>
<p>An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes' effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.</p>
<p><strong>Banded Mail:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong>Breastplate:</strong> It comes with a helmet and greaves. </p>
<p><strong>Buckler:</strong> This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed weapon), but you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off hand, you don't get the buckler's AC bonus for the rest of the round.</p>
<p>You can't bash someone with a buckler.</p>
<p><strong>Chain Shirt:</strong> A chain shirt comes with a steel cap.</p>
<p><strong>Chainmail:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong>Full Plate:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4x100) gold pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Gauntlet, Locked:</strong> This armored gauntlet has small chains and braces that allow the wearer to attach a weapon to the gauntlet so that it cannot be dropped easily. It provides a +10 bonus on any roll made to keep from being disarmed in combat. Removing a weapon from a locked gauntlet or attaching a weapon to a locked gauntlet is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>The price given is for a single locked gauntlet. The weight given applies only if you're wearing a breastplate, light armor, or no armor. Otherwise, the locked gauntlet replaces a gauntlet you already have as part of the armor.</p>
<p>While the gauntlet is locked, you can't use the hand wearing it for casting spells or employing skills. (You can still cast spells with somatic components, provided that your other hand is free.)</p>
<p>Like a normal gauntlet, a locked gauntlet lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike.</p>
<p><strong>Half-Plate:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong>Scale Mail:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong>Shield, Heavy, Wooden or Steel:</strong> You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A heavy shield is so heavy that you can't use your shield hand for anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Wooden or Steel:</strong> Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to special attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Shield Bash Attacks:</strong> You can bash an opponent with a heavy shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table: Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a heavy shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a heavy shield as a one-handed weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</p>
<p><strong>Shield, Light, Wooden or Steel:</strong> You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A light shield's weight lets you carry other items in that hand, although you cannot use weapons with it.</p>
<p><strong>Wooden or Steel:</strong> Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to special attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Shield Bash Attacks:</strong> You can bash an opponent with a light shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table: Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a light shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a light shield as a light weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</p>
<p><strong>Shield, Tower:</strong> This massive wooden shield is nearly as tall as you are. In most situations, it provides the indicated shield bonus to your AC. However, you can instead use it as total cover, though you must give up your attacks to do so. The shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else.</p>
<p>When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield's encumbrance.</p>
<p><strong>Shield Spikes:</strong> When added to your shield, these spikes turn it into a martial piercing weapon that increases the damage dealt by a shield bash as if the shield were designed for a creature one size category larger than you. You can't put spikes on a buckler or a tower shield. Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is like making a shield bash attack (see above).</p>
<p>An enhancement bonus on a spiked shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but a spiked shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</p>
<p><strong>Splint Mail:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
<h2 id="masterwork-armor"><a class="header" href="#masterwork-armor">Masterwork Armor</a></h2>
<p>Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor or shields. Such a well-made item functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1. </p>
<p>A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal cost for that type of armor or shield.</p>
<p>The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a bonus on attack or damage rolls, even if the armor or shield is used as a weapon.</p>
<p>All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality.</p>
<p>You can't add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork item.</p>
<h2 id="armor-for-unusual-creatures"><a class="header" href="#armor-for-unusual-creatures">Armor For Unusual Creatures</a></h2>
<p>Armor and shields for unusually big creatures, unusually little creatures, and nonhumanoid creatures have different costs and weights from those given on Table: Armor and Shields.

<p>The time required to don armor depends on its type; see Table: Donning Armor.</p>
<p><strong>Don:</strong> This column tells how long it takes a character to put the armor on. (One minute is 10 rounds.) Readying (strapping on) a shield is only a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Don Hastily:</strong> This column tells how long it takes to put the armor on in a hurry. The armor check penalty and armor bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 point worse than normal. </p>
<p><strong>Remove:</strong> This column tells how long it takes to get the armor off. Loosing a shield (removing it from the arm and dropping it) is only a move action.</p>

</ol>
<p>Few of the pieces of adventuring gear found on Table: Goods and Services are described below, along with any special benefits they confer on the user (&quot;you&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>Caltrops:</strong> A caltrop is a four-pronged iron spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2- pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.</p>
<p>Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by one-half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical curing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.</p>
<p>Caltrops may not be effective against unusual opponents.</p>
<p><strong>Candle:</strong> A candle dimly illuminates a 5-foot radius and burns for 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>Chain:</strong> Chain has hardness 10 and 5 hit points. It can be burst with a DC 26 Strength check.</p>
<p><strong>Crowbar:</strong> A crowbar it grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made for such purposes. If used in combat, treat a crowbar as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.</p>
<p><strong>Flint and Steel:</strong> Lighting a torch with flint and steel is a full-round action, and lighting any other fire with them takes at least that long.</p>
<p><strong>Grappling Hook:</strong> Throwing a grappling hook successfully requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 per 10 feet of distance thrown).</p>
<p><strong>Hammer:</strong> If a hammer is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a spiked gauntlet of its size.</p>
<p><strong>Ink:</strong> This is black ink. You can buy ink in other colors, but it costs twice as much.</p>
<p><strong>Jug, Clay:</strong> This basic ceramic jug is fitted with a stopper and holds 1 gallon of liquid.</p>
<p><strong>Lamp, Common:</strong> A lamp clearly illuminates a 15-foot radius, provides shadowy illumination out to a 30-foot radius, and burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand. </p>
<p><strong>Lantern, Bullseye:</strong> A bullseye lantern provides clear illumination in a 60-foot cone and shadowy illumination in a 120-foot cone. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a bullseye lantern in one hand.</p>
<p><strong>Lantern, Hooded:</strong> A hooded lantern clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a hooded lantern in one hand.</p>
<p><strong>Lock:</strong> The DC to open a lock with the Open Lock skill depends on the lock's quality: simple (DC 20), average (DC 25), good (DC 30), or superior (DC 40).</p>
<p><strong>Manacles and Manacles, Masterwork:</strong> Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.</p>
<p>Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the cost of the manacles.</p>
<p>For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature.</p>
<p>For a Large creature, manacles cost ten times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, one hundred times this amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles.</p>
<p><strong>Oil:</strong> A pint of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern. You can use a flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist's fire, except that it takes a full round action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully.</p>
<p>You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Ram, Portable:</strong> This iron-shod wooden beam gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to break open a door and it allows a second person to help you without having to roll, increasing your bonus by 2.</p>
<p><strong>Rope, Hempen:</strong> This rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 23 Strength check.</p>
<p><strong>Rope, Silk:</strong> This rope has 4 hit points and can be burst with a DC 24 Strength check. It is so supple that it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Rope checks.</p>
<p><strong>Spyglass:</strong> Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.</p>
<p><strong>Torch:</strong> A torch burns for 1 hour, clearly illuminating a 20-foot radius and providing shadowy illumination out to a 40- foot radius. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage.</p>
<p><strong>Vial:</strong> A vial holds 1 ounce of liquid. The stoppered container usually is no more than 1 inch wide and 3 inches high.</p>

<p>Any of these substances except for the everburning torch and holy water can be made by a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill.</p>
<p><strong>Acid:</strong> You can throw a flask of acid as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist's Fire:</strong> You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.</p>
<p>A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Antitoxin:</strong> If you drink antitoxin, you get a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison for 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>Everburning Torch:</strong> This otherwise normal torch has a continual flame spell cast upon it. An everburning torch clearly illuminates a 20-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination out to a 40-foot radius.</p>
<p><strong>Holy Water:</strong> Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon.</p>
<p>Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.</p>
<p>Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit).</p>
<p><strong>Smokestick:</strong> This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when ignited. The smoke fills a 10- foot cube (treat the effect as a fog cloud spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Sunrod:</strong> This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. It clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.</p>
<p><strong>Tanglefoot Bag:</strong> When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.</p>
<p>A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of universal solvent to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Thunderstone:</strong> You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a -4 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast.</p>
<p>Since you don't need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the target square as AC 5.</p>
<p><strong>Tindertwig:</strong> The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action (rather than a full-round action), and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action.</p>
<h2 id="tools-and-skill-kits"><a class="header" href="#tools-and-skill-kits">Tools And Skill Kits</a></h2>
<p><strong>Alchemist's Lab:</strong> An alchemist's lab always has the perfect tool for making alchemical items, so it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks. It has no bearing on the costs related to the Craft (alchemy) skill. Without this lab, a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill is assumed to have enough tools to use the skill but not enough to get the +2 bonus that the lab provides.</p>
<p><strong>Artisan's Tools:</strong> These special tools include the items needed to pursue any craft. Without them, you have to use improvised tools (-2 penalty on Craft checks), if you can do the job at all.</p>
<p><strong>Artisan's Tools, Masterwork:</strong> These tools serve the same purpose as artisan's tools (above), but masterwork artisan's tools are the perfect tools for the job, so you get a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft checks made with them.</p>
<p><strong>Climber's Kit:</strong> This is the perfect tool for climbing and gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks.</p>
<p><strong>Disguise Kit:</strong> The kit is the perfect tool for disguise and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. A disguise kit is exhausted after ten uses.</p>
<p><strong>Healer's Kit:</strong> It is the perfect tool for healing and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks. A healer's kit is exhausted after ten uses.</p>
<p><strong>Holy Symbol, Silver or Wooden:</strong> A holy symbol focuses positive energy. A cleric or paladin uses it as the focus for his spells and as a tool for turning undead. Each religion has its own holy symbol.</p>
<p><strong>Unholy Symbols:</strong> An unholy symbol is like a holy symbol except that it focuses negative energy and is used by evil clerics (or by neutral clerics who want to cast evil spells or command undead).</p>
<p><strong>Magnifying Glass:</strong> This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a full-round action. A magnifying glass grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed.</p>
<p><strong>Musical Instrument, Common or Masterwork:</strong> A masterwork instrument grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks involving its use.</p>
<p><strong>Scale, Merchant's:</strong> A scale grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Component Pouch:</strong> A spellcaster with a spell component pouch is assumed to have all the material components and focuses needed for spellcasting, except for those components that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and focuses that wouldn't fit in a pouch.</p>
<p><strong>Spellbook, Wizard's (Blank):</strong> A spellbook has 100 pages of parchment, and each spell takes up one page per spell level (one page each for 0-level spells).</p>
<p><strong>Thieves' Tools:</strong> This kit contains the tools you need to use the Disable Device and Open Lock skills. Without these tools, you must improvise tools, and you take a -2 circumstance penalty on Disable Device and Open Locks checks.</p>
<p><strong>Thieves' Tools, Masterwork:</strong> This kit contains extra tools and tools of better make, which grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Disable Device and Open Lock checks.</p>
<p><strong>Tool, Masterwork:</strong> This well-made item is the perfect tool for the job. It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on a related skill check (if any). Bonuses provided by multiple masterwork items used toward the same skill check do not stack.</p>
<p><strong>Water Clock:</strong> This large, bulky contrivance gives the time accurate to within half an hour per day since it was last set. It requires a source of water, and it must be kept still because it marks time by the regulated flow of droplets of water.</p>

| Scholar's outfit | 5 gp | | 6 lb.1 | |  |
| Traveler's outfit | 1 gp | | 5 lb.1 | |  |</p>
<p><strong>Artisan's Outfit:</strong> This outfit includes a shirt with buttons, a skirt or pants with a drawstring, shoes, and perhaps a cap or hat. It may also include a belt or a leather or cloth apron for carrying tools.</p>
<p><strong>Cleric's Vestments:</strong> These ecclesiastical clothes are for performing priestly functions, not for adventuring.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Weather Outfit:</strong> A cold weather outfit includes a wool coat, linen shirt, wool cap, heavy cloak, thick pants or skirt, and boots. This outfit grants a +5 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against exposure to cold weather.</p>
<p><strong>Courtier's Outfit:</strong> This outfit includes fancy, tailored clothes in whatever fashion happens to be the current style in the courts of the nobles. Anyone trying to influence nobles or courtiers while wearing street dress will have a hard time of it (-2 penalty on Charisma-based skill checks to influence such individuals). If you wear this outfit without jewelry (costing an additional 50 gp), you look like an out-of-place commoner.</p>
<p><strong>Entertainer's Outfit:</strong> This set of flashy, perhaps even gaudy, clothes is for entertaining. While the outfit looks whimsical, its practical design lets you tumble, dance, walk a tightrope, or just run (if the audience turns ugly).</p>
<p><strong>Explorer's Outfit:</strong> This is a full set of clothes for someone who never knows what to expect. It includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak. Rather than a leather skirt, a leather overtunic may be worn over a cloth skirt. The clothes have plenty of pockets (especially the cloak). The outfit also includes any extra items you might need, such as a scarf or a wide-brimmed hat.</p>
<p><strong>Monk's Outfit:</strong> This simple outfit includes sandals, loose breeches, and a loose shirt, and is all bound together with sashes. The outfit is designed to give you maximum mobility, and it's made of high-quality fabric. You can hide small weapons in pockets hidden in the folds, and the sashes are strong enough to serve as short ropes.</p>
<p><strong>Noble's Outfit:</strong> This set of clothes is designed specifically to be expensive and to show it. Precious metals and gems are worked into the clothing. To fit into the noble crowd, every would-be noble also needs a signet ring (see Adventuring Gear, above) and jewelry (worth at least 100 gp).</p>
<p><strong>Peasant's Outfit:</strong> This set of clothes consists of a loose shirt and baggy breeches, or a loose shirt and skirt or overdress. Cloth wrappings are used for shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Royal Outfit:</strong> This is just the clothing, not the royal scepter, crown, ring, and other accoutrements. Royal clothes are ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance.</p>
<p><strong>Scholar's Outfit:</strong> Perfect for a scholar, this outfit includes a robe, a belt, a cap, soft shoes, and possibly a cloak.</p>
<p><strong>Traveler's Outfit:</strong> This set of clothes consists of boots, a wool skirt or breeches, a sturdy belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), and an ample cloak with a hood.</p>

<p><strong>Meals:</strong> Poor meals might be composed of bread, baked turnips, onions, and water. Common meals might consist of bread, chicken stew, carrots, and watered-down ale or wine. Good meals might be composed of bread and pastries, beef, peas, and ale or wine.</p>

<p><strong>Barding, Medium Creature and Large Creature:</strong> Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on Table: Armor and Shields.</p>
<p>Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as much as armor for a human (a Medium humanoid creature) and also weighs twice as much as the armor found on Table: Armor and Shields (see Armor for Unusual Creatures). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.</p>
<p>|   | | -------- Base Speed -------- | |  |
| Barding | | (40 ft.) | (50 ft.) | (60 ft.) | |  |
| Medium | | 30 ft. | 35 ft. | 40 ft. | |  |
| Heavy | | 30 ft.1 | 35 ft.1 | 40 ft.1 | |  |</p>
<ol>
<li>A mount wearing heavy armor moves at only triple its normal speed when running instead of quadruple.</li>
</ol>
<p>Flying mounts can't fly in medium or heavy barding.</p>
<p>Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on Table: Donning Armor. A barded animal cannot be used to carry any load other than the rider and normal saddlebags.</p>
<p><strong>Dog, Riding:</strong> This Medium dog is specially trained to carry a Small humanoid rider. It is brave in combat like a warhorse. You take no damage when you fall from a riding dog.</p>
<p><strong>Donkey or Mule:</strong> Donkeys and mules are stolid in the face of danger, hardy, surefooted, and capable of carrying heavy loads over vast distances. Unlike a horse, a donkey or a mule is willing (though not eager) to enter dungeons and other strange or threatening places.</p>
<p><strong>Feed:</strong> Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze to sustain themselves, but providing feed for them is much better. If you have a riding dog, you have to feed it at least some meat.</p>
<p><strong>Horse:</strong> A horse (other than a pony) is suitable as a mount for a human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, or half-orc. A pony is smaller than a horse and is a suitable mount for a gnome or halfling.</p>
<p>Warhorses and warponies can be ridden easily into combat. Light horses, ponies, and heavy horses are hard to control in combat.</p>
<p><strong>Saddle, Exotic:</strong> An exotic saddle is like a normal saddle of the same sort except that it is designed for an unusual mount. Exotic saddles come in military, pack, and riding styles.</p>
<p><strong>Saddle, Military:</strong> A military saddle braces the rider, providing a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle. If you're knocked unconscious while in a military saddle, you have a 75% chance to stay in the saddle (compared to 50% for a riding saddle).</p>
<p><strong>Saddle, Pack:</strong> A pack saddle holds gear and supplies, but not a rider. It holds as much gear as the mount can carry.</p>
<p><strong>Saddle, Riding:</strong> The standard riding saddle supports a rider.</p>

<p><strong>Carriage:</strong> This four-wheeled vehicle can transport as many as four people within an enclosed cab, plus two drivers. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A carriage comes with the harness needed to pull it.</p>
<p><strong>Cart:</strong> This two-wheeled vehicle can be drawn by a single horse (or other beast of burden). It comes with a harness.</p>
<p><strong>Galley:</strong> This three-masted ship has seventy oars on either side and requires a total crew of 200. A galley is 130 feet long and 20 feet wide, and it can carry 150 tons of cargo or 250 soldiers. For 8,000 gp more, it can be fitted with a ram and castles with firing platforms fore, aft, and amidships. This ship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It moves about 4 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.</p>
<p><strong>Keelboat:</strong> This 50- to 75-foot-long ship is 15 to 20 feet wide and has a few oars to supplement its single mast with a square sail. It has a crew of eight to fifteen and can carry 40 to 50 tons of cargo or 100 soldiers. It can make sea voyages, as well as sail down rivers (thanks to its flat bottom). It moves about 1 mile per hour.</p>
<p><strong>Longship:</strong> This 75-foot-long ship with forty oars requires a total crew of 50. It has a single mast and a square sail, and it can carry 50 tons of cargo or 120 soldiers. A longship can make sea voyages. It moves about 3 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.</p>
<p><strong>Rowboat:</strong> This 8- to 12-foot-long boat holds two or three Medium passengers. It moves about 1-1/2 miles per hour.</p>
<p><strong>Sailing Ship:</strong> This larger, seaworthy ship is 75 to 90 feet long and 20 feet wide and has a crew of 20. It can carry 150 tons of cargo. It has square sails on its two masts and can make sea voyages. It moves about 2 miles per hour.</p>
<p><strong>Sled:</strong> This is a wagon on runners for moving through snow and over ice. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A sled comes with the harness needed to pull it.</p>
<p><strong>Wagon:</strong> This is a four-wheeled, open vehicle for transporting heavy loads. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A wagon comes with the harness needed to pull it.</p>
<p><strong>Warship:</strong> This 100-foot-long ship has a single mast, although oars can also propel it. It has a crew of 60 to 80 rowers. This ship can carry 160 soldiers, but not for long distances, since there isn't room for supplies to support that many people. The warship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It is not used for cargo. It moves about 2-1/2 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.</p>

<p>Sometimes the best solution for a problem is to hire someone else to take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>Coach Cab:</strong> The price given is for a ride in a coach that transports people (and light cargo) between towns. For a ride in a cab that transports passengers within a city, 1 copper piece usually takes you anywhere you need to go.</p>
<p><strong>Hireling, Trained:</strong> The amount given is the typical daily wage for mercenary warriors, masons, craftsmen, scribes, teamsters, and other trained hirelings. This value represents a minimum wage; many such hirelings require significantly higher pay.</p>
<p><strong>Hireling, Untrained:</strong> The amount shown is the typical daily wage for laborers, porters, cooks, maids, and other menial workers.</p>
<p><strong>Messenger:</strong> This entry includes horse-riding messengers and runners. Those willing to carry a message to a place they were going anyway may ask for only half the indicated amount.</p>
<p><strong>Road or Gate Toll:</strong> A toll is sometimes charged to cross a well-trodden, well-kept, and well-guarded road to pay for patrols on it and for its upkeep. Occasionally, a large walled city charges a toll to enter or exit (or sometimes just to enter).</p>
<p><strong>Ship's Passage:</strong> Most ships do not specialize in passengers, but many have the capability to take a few along when transporting cargo. Double the given cost for creatures larger than Medium or creatures that are otherwise difficult to bring aboard a ship.</p>
<p><strong>Spell:</strong> The indicated amount is how much it costs to get a spellcaster to cast a spell for you. This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at his or her convenience (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to prepare the spell in question). If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell you need to negotiate with him or her, and the default answer is no.</p>
<p>The cost given is for a spell with no cost for a material component or focus component and no XP cost. If the spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell.</p>
<p>If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell. If the spell has an XP cost, add 5 gp per XP lost. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a spell, which isn't certain). In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance, you will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell, even if you aren't returning with the caster.</p>
<p>In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level spells, a large city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a metropolis isn't guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="special-materials"><a class="header" href="#special-materials">Special Materials</a></h1>
<p>In addition to magic items created with spells, some substances have innate special properties.</p>
<p>If you make a suit of armor or weapon out of more than one special material, you get the benefit of only the most prevalent material. However, you can build a double weapon with each head made of a different special material. </p>
<h2 id="special-weapons-materials"><a class="header" href="#special-weapons-materials">Special Weapons Materials</a></h2>
<p>Each of the special materials described below has a definite game effect. Some creatures have damage reduction based on their creature type or core concept. Some are resistant to all but a special type of damage, such as that dealt by evil-aligned weapons or bludgeoning weapons. Others are vulnerable to weapons of a particular material. Characters may choose to carry several different types of weapons, depending upon the campaign and types of creatures they most commonly encounter. </p>
<h2 id="special-material-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#special-material-descriptions">Special Material Descriptions</a></h2>
<h3 id="adamantine"><a class="header" href="#adamantine">Adamantine</a></h3>
<p>This ultrahard metal adds to the quality of a weapon or suit of armor. Weapons fashioned from adamantine have a natural ability to bypass hardness when sundering weapons or attacking objects, ignoring hardness less than 20. Armor made from adamantine grants its wearer damage reduction of 1/- if it's light armor, 2/- if it's medium armor, and 3/- if it's heavy armor. Adamantine is so costly that weapons and armor made from it are always of masterwork quality; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below. Thus, adamantine weapons and ammunition have a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls, and the armor check penalty of adamantine armor is lessened by 1 compared to ordinary armor of its type. Items without metal parts cannot be made from adamantine. An arrow could be made of adamantine, but a quarterstaff could not.</p>
<p>Only weapons, armor, and shields normally made of metal can be fashioned from adamantine. Weapons, armor and shields normally made of steel that are made of adamantine have one-third more hit points than normal. Adamantine has 40 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 20.</p>
<p>| Type of Adamantine Item | | Item Cost Modifier | |  |
| Ammunition | | +60 gp | |  |
| Light armor | | +5,000 gp | |  |
| Medium armor | | +10,000 gp | |  |
| Heavy armor | | +15,000 gp | |  |
| Weapon | | +3,000 gp | |  |</p>
<h3 id="darkwood"><a class="header" href="#darkwood">Darkwood</a></h3>
<p>This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very light. Any wooden or mostly wooden item (such as a bow, an arrow, or a spear) made from darkwood is considered a masterwork item and weighs only half as much as a normal wooden item of that type. Items not normally made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a battleaxe or a mace) either cannot be made from darkwood or do not gain any special benefit from being made of darkwood. The armor check penalty of a darkwood shield is lessened by 2 compared to an ordinary shield of its type. To determine the price of a darkwood item, use the original weight but add 10 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item.</p>
<p>Darkwood has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5.</p>
<h3 id="dragonhide"><a class="header" href="#dragonhide">Dragonhide</a></h3>
<p>Armorsmiths can work with the hides of dragons to produce armor or shields of masterwork quality. One dragon produces enough hide for a single suit of masterwork hide armor for a creature one size category smaller than the dragon. By selecting only choice scales and bits of hide, an armorsmith can produce one suit of masterwork banded mail for a creature two sizes smaller, one suit of masterwork half-plate for a creature three sizes smaller, or one masterwork breastplate or suit of full plate for a creature four sizes smaller. In each case, enough hide is available to produce a small or large masterwork shield in addition to the armor, provided that the dragon is Large or larger.</p>
<p>Because dragonhide armor isn't made of metal, druids can wear it without penalty.</p>
<p>Dragonhide armor costs double what masterwork armor of that type ordinarily costs, but it takes no longer to make than ordinary armor of that type.</p>
<p>Dragonhide has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.</p>
<h3 id="iron-cold"><a class="header" href="#iron-cold">Iron, Cold</a></h3>
<p>This iron, mined deep underground, known for its effectiveness against fey creatures, is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its delicate properties. Weapons made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts. Also, any magical enhancements cost an additional 2,000 gp. </p>
<p>Items without metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An arrow could be made of cold iron, but a quarterstaff could not.</p>
<p>A double weapon that has only half of it made of cold iron increases its cost by 50%.</p>
<p>Cold iron has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.</p>
<h3 id="mithral"><a class="header" href="#mithral">Mithral</a></h3>
<p>Mithral is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than iron but just as hard. When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create armor and is occasionally used for other items as well. Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light. Spell failure chances for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2, and armor check penalties are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0).</p>
<p>An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. In the case of weapons, this lighter weight does not change a weapon's size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether it is light, one-handed, or two-handed). Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of mithral. (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a scythe cannot be.)</p>
<p>Weapons or armors fashioned from mithral are always masterwork items as well; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below.</p>
<p>Mithral has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 15.</p>
<p>| Type of Mithral Item | | Item Cost Modifier | |  |
| Light armor | | +1,000 gp | |  |
| Medium armor | | +4,000 gp | |  |
| Heavy armor | | +9,000 gp | |  |
| Shield | | +1,000 gp | |  |
| Other items | | +500 gp/lb. | |  |</p>
<h3 id="silver-alchemical"><a class="header" href="#silver-alchemical">Silver, Alchemical</a></h3>
<p>A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bond silver to a weapon made of steel so that it bypasses the damage reduction of creatures such as lycanthropes.</p>
<p>On a successful attack with a silvered weapon, the wielder takes a -1 penalty on the damage roll (with the usual minimum of 1 point of damage). The alchemical silvering process can't be applied to nonmetal items, and it doesn't work on rare metals such as adamantine, cold iron, and mithral.</p>
<p>Alchemical silver has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.</p>
<p>| Type of Alchemical Silver Item | | Item Cost Modifier | |  |
| Ammunition | | +2 gp | |  |
| Light weapon | | +20 gp | |  |
| One-handed weapon, or one head of a double weapon | | +90 gp | |  |
| Two-handed weapon, or both heads of a double weapon | | +180 gp | |  |</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="magic-item-basics"><a class="header" href="#magic-item-basics">Magic Item Basics</a></h1>
<p>Magic items are divided into categories: armor, weapons, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, and wondrous items. In addition, some magic items are cursed or intelligent. Finally, a few magic items are of such rarity and power that they are considered to belong to a category of their own: artifacts. Artifacts are classified in turn as minor (extremely rare but not one-of-a-kind items) or major (each one unique and extremely potent).</p>
<p><strong>Armor and Shields:</strong> Magic armor (including shields) offers improved, magical protection to the wearer. Some of these items confer abilities beyond a benefit to Armor Class. </p>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Magic weapons are created with a variety of combat powers and almost always improve the attack and damage rolls of the wielder as well.</p>
<p><strong>Potions:</strong> A potion is an elixir concocted with a spell-like effect that affects only the drinker.</p>
<p><strong>Rings:</strong> A ring is a circular metal band worn on the finger (no more than two rings per wearer) that has a spell-like power (often a constant effect that affects the wearer).</p>
<p><strong>Rods:</strong> A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power unlike that of any known spell.</p>
<p><strong>Scrolls:</strong> A scroll is a spell magically inscribed onto paper or parchment so that it can be used later.</p>
<p><strong>Staffs:</strong> A staff has a number of different (but often related) spell effects. A newly created staff has 50 charges, and each use of the staff depletes one or more of those charges.</p>
<p><strong>Wands:</strong> A wand is a short stick imbued with the power to cast a specific spell. A newly created wand has 50 charges, and each use of the wand depletes one of those charges.</p>
<p><strong>Wondrous Items:</strong> These objects include magic jewelry, tools, books, clothing, and much more.</p>
<h2 id="magic-items-and-detect-magic"><a class="header" href="#magic-items-and-detect-magic">Magic Items and Detect Magic</a></h2>
<p>When detect magic identifies a magic item's school of magic, this information refers to the school of the spell placed within the potion, scroll, or wand, or the prerequisite given for the item. The description of each item provides its aura strength and the school it belongs to.</p>
<p>If more than one spell is given as a prerequisite, use the highest-level spell. If no spells are included in the prerequisites, use the following default guidelines.</p>
<p>| Item Nature | School | |  |
| Armor and protection items | Abjuration | |  |
| Weapons or offensive items | Evocation | |  |
| Bonus to ability score, on skill check, etc. | Transmutation | |  |</p>
<h2 id="using-items"><a class="header" href="#using-items">Using Items</a></h2>
<p>To use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation simply means putting a ring on your finger. Some items, once donned, function constantly. In most cases, using an item requires a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, spell completion items are treated like spells in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Activating a magic item is a standard action unless the item description indicates otherwise. However, the casting time of a spell is the time required to activate the same power in an item, regardless of the type of magic item, unless the item description specifically states otherwise.</p>
<p>The four ways to activate magic items are described below.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Completion:</strong> This is the activation method for scrolls. A scroll is a spell that is mostly finished. The preparation is done for the caster, so no preparation time is needed beforehand as with normal spellcasting. All that's left to do is perform the finishing parts of the spellcasting (the final gestures, words, and so on). To use a spell completion item safely, a character must be of high enough level in the right class to cast the spell already. If he can't already cast the spell, there's a chance he'll make a mistake. Activating a spell completion item is a standard action and provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as casting a spell does.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Trigger:</strong> Spell trigger activation is similar to spell completion, but it's even simpler. No gestures or spell finishing is needed, just a special knowledge of spellcasting that an appropriate character would know, and a single word that must be spoken. Anyone with a spell on his or her spell list knows how to use a spell trigger item that stores that spell. (This is the case even for a character who can't actually cast spells, such as a 3rd-level paladin.) The user must still determine what spell is stored in the item before she can activate it. Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Command Word:</strong> If no activation method is suggested either in the magic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means that a character speaks the word and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed.</p>
<p>A command word can be a real word, but when this is the case, the holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often, the command word is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common use. Activating a command word magic item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Sometimes the command word to activate an item is written right on the item. Occasionally, it might be hidden within a pattern or design engraved on, carved into, or built into the item, or the item might bear a clue to the command word.</p>
<p>The Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) skills might be useful in helping to identify command words or deciphering clues regarding them. A successful check against DC 30 is needed to come up with the word itself. If that check is failed, succeeding on a second check (DC 25) might provide some insight into a clue.</p>
<p>The spells identify and analyze dweomer both reveal command words.</p>
<p><strong>Use Activated:</strong> This type of item simply has to be used in order to activate it. A character has to drink a potion, swing a sword, interpose a shield to deflect a blow in combat, look through a lens, sprinkle dust, wear a ring, or don a hat. Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Continually functioning items are practically always items that one wears. A few must simply be in the character's possession (on his person). However, some items made for wearing must still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a command word (see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen. The description of an item states whether a command word is needed in such a case.</p>
<p>Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated magic item is either a standard action or not an action at all and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes an attack of opportunity in itself. If the use of the item takes time before a magical effect occurs, then use activation is a standard action. If the item's activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time use activation is not an action at all.</p>
<p>Use activation doesn't mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes automatically, such from drinking a potion or swinging a sword.</p>
<h2 id="size-and-magic-items"><a class="header" href="#size-and-magic-items">Size And Magic Items</a></h2>
<p>When an article of magic clothing or jewelry is discovered, most of the time size shouldn't be an issue. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they adjust themselves magically to the wearer. Size should not keep characters of various kinds from using magic items.</p>
<p>There may be rare exceptions, especially with racial specific items. </p>
<p><strong>Armor and Weapon Sizes:</strong> Armor and weapons that are found at random have a 30% chance of being Small (01-30), a 60% chance of being Medium (31-90), and a 10% chance of being any other size (91-100).</p>
<h2 id="magic-items-on-the-body"><a class="header" href="#magic-items-on-the-body">Magic Items On The Body</a></h2>
<p>Many magic items need to be donned by a character who wants to employ them or benefit from their abilities. It's possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as twelve magic items at the same time. However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body.</p>
<p>A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of one item from each of the following groups, keyed to which place on the body the item is worn.</p>
<ul>
<li>One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the head</li>
<li>One pair of eye lenses or goggles on or over the eyes</li>
<li>One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab around the neck</li>
<li>One vest, vestment, or shirt on the torso</li>
<li>One robe or suit of armor on the body (over a vest, vestment, or shirt)</li>
<li>One belt around the waist (over a robe or suit of armor)</li>
<li>One cloak, cape, or mantle around the shoulders (over a robe or suit of armor)</li>
<li>One pair of bracers or bracelets on the arms or wrists</li>
<li>One glove, pair of gloves, or pair of gauntlets on the hands</li>
<li>One ring on each hand (or two rings on one hand)</li>
<li>One pair of boots or shoes on the feet</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes. However, additional items beyond those listed above have no effect. </p>
<p>Some items can be worn or carried without taking up space on a character's body. The description of an item indicates when an item has this property.</p>
<h2 id="saving-throws-against-magic-item-powers"><a class="header" href="#saving-throws-against-magic-item-powers">Saving Throws Against Magic Item Powers</a></h2>
<p>Magic items produce spells or spell-like effects. For a saving throw against a spell or spell-like effect from a magic item, the DC is 10 + the level of the spell or effect + the ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to cast that level of spell. </p>
<p>Staffs are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw as if the wielder cast the spell, including caster level and all modifiers to save DC. </p>
<p>Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various effects, particularly when the effect has no exact spell equivalent (making its level otherwise difficult to determine quickly).</p>
<h2 id="damaging-magic-items"><a class="header" href="#damaging-magic-items">Damaging Magic Items</a></h2>
<p>A magic item doesn't need to make a saving throw unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his save. Magic items should always get a saving throw against spells that might deal damage to them-- even against attacks from which a nonmagical item would normally get no chance to save. Magic items use the same saving throw bonus for all saves, no matter what the type (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will). A magic item's saving throw bonus equals 2 + one-half its caster level (round down). The only exceptions to this are intelligent magic items, which make Will saves based on their own Wisdom scores.</p>
<p>Magic items, unless otherwise noted, take damage as nonmagical items of the same sort. A damaged magic item continues to function, but if it is destroyed, all its magical power is lost.</p>
<h2 id="repairing-magic-items"><a class="header" href="#repairing-magic-items">Repairing Magic Items</a></h2>
<p>Some magic items take damage over the course of an adventure. It costs no more to repair a magic item with the Craft skill than it does to repair its nonmagical counterpart. The make whole spell also repairs a damaged--but not completely broken--magic item.</p>
<h2 id="intelligent-items"><a class="header" href="#intelligent-items">Intelligent Items</a></h2>
<p>Some magic items, particularly weapons, have an intelligence all their own. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to those with a single use or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.)</p>
<p>In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence. </p>
<h2 id="cursed-items"><a class="header" href="#cursed-items">Cursed Items</a></h2>
<p>Some items are cursed--incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces. Cursed items might be particularly dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor flaw, an inconvenient requirement, or an unpredictable nature. Randomly generated items are cursed 5% of the time. </p>
<h2 id="charges-doses-and-multiple-uses"><a class="header" href="#charges-doses-and-multiple-uses">Charges, Doses, And Multiple Uses</a></h2>
<p>Many items, particularly wands and staffs, are limited in power by the number of charges they hold. Normally, charged items have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of charges left (round down, minimum 1). If the item has a maximum number of charges other than 50, roll randomly to determine how many charges are left. </p>
<p>Prices listed are always for fully charged items. (When an item is created, it is fully charged.) For an item that's worthless when its charges run out (which is the case for almost all charged items), the value of the partially used item is proportional to the number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its charges, only part of the item's value is based on the number of charges left.</p>
<h2 id="magic-item-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#magic-item-descriptions">Magic Item Descriptions</a></h2>
<p>Each general type of magic item gets an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items.</p>
<p>General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other material. The AC, hardness, hit points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some magic items. The AC assumes that the item is unattended and includes a -5 penalty for the item's effective Dexterity of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the creature's Dexterity modifier in place of the -5 penalty.</p>
<p>Some individual items, notably those that simply store spells and nothing else, don't get full-blown descriptions. Reference the spell's description for details, modified by the form of the item (potion, scroll, wand, and so on). Assume that the spell is cast at the minimum level required to cast it</p>
<p>Items with full descriptions have their powers detailed, and each of the following topics is covered in notational form at the end of the description.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Aura:</strong> Most of the time, a detect magic spell will reveal the school of magic associated with a magic item and the strength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item's notational entry. See the detect magic spell description for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caster Level:</strong> The next item in a notational entry gives the caster level of the item, indicating its relative power. The caster level determines the item's saving throw bonus, as well as range or other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable). It also determines the level that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a dispel magic spell or similar situation. This information is given in the form &quot;CL x,&quot; where &quot;CL&quot; is an abbreviation for caster level and &quot;x&quot; is an ordinal number representing the caster level itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For potions, scrolls, and wands, the creator can set the caster level of an item at any number high enough to cast the stored spell and not higher than her own caster level. For other magic items, the caster level is determined by the item itself. In this case, the creator's caster level must be as high as the item's caster level (and prerequisites may effectively put a higher minimum on the creator's level).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Certain requirements must be met in order for a character to create a magic item. These include feats, spells, and miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and race or kind. The prerequisites for creation of an item are given immediately following the item's caster level.</li>
</ul>
<p>A spell prerequisite may be provided by a character who has prepared the spell (or who knows the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard), or through the use of a spell completion or spell trigger magic item or a spell-like ability that produces the desired spell effect. For each day that passes in the creation process, the creator must expend one spell completion item or one charge from a spell trigger item if either of those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.</p>
<p>It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.</p>
<p>If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator's level must be known. The character designated as the creator pays the XP required to make the item.</p>
<p>Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one or more spells (or some other requirement in addition to the feat).</p>
<p>When two spells at the end of a list are separated by &quot;or,&quot; one of those spells is required in addition to every other spell mentioned prior to the last two.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Price:</strong> This gold piece value, given following the word &quot;Price,&quot; represents the price someone should expect to pay to buy the item. The market price for an item that can be constructed with an item creation feat is usually equal to the base price plus the price for any components (material or XP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost to Create:</strong> The next part of a notational entry is the cost in gp and XP to create the item, given following the word</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Cost.&quot; This information appears only for items with components (material or XP), which make their market prices higher than their base prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the costs of the components.</p>
<p>Items without components do not have a &quot;Cost&quot; entry. For them, the market price and the base price are the same. The cost in gp is 1/2 the market price, and the cost in XP is 1/25 the market price.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weight:</strong> The notational entry for many wondrous items ends with a value for the item's weight. When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining how much of a load a character can carry).</li>
</ul>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="weapons-1"><a class="header" href="#weapons-1">Weapons</a></h1>
<p>Magic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses to both attack and damage rolls when used in combat. All magic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonus on attack rolls does not stack with their enhancement bonus on attack rolls.</p>
<p>Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonus applies to either type of attack.</p>
<p>In addition to an enhancement bonus, weapons may have special abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses (except where specifically noted). A single weapon cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
<p>A weapon or a kind of ammunition may be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01-95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96-100 indicates that it is made of a special material.</p>
<p><strong>Caster Level for Weapons:</strong> The caster level of a weapon with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus and no other abilities, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Damage Dice:</strong> Some magic weapons deal additional dice of damage. Unlike other modifiers to damage, additional dice of damage are not multiplied when the attacker scores a critical hit.</p>
<p><strong>Ranged Weapons and Ammunition:</strong> The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the two enhancement bonuses applies.</p>
<p>Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already have).</p>
<p><strong>Magic Ammunition and Breakage:</strong> When a magic arrow, crossbow bolt, or sling bullet misses its target, there is a 50% chance it breaks or otherwise is rendered useless. A magic arrow, bolt, or bullet that hits is destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Light Generation:</strong> Fully 30% of magic weapons shed light equivalent to a light spell (bright light in a 20-foot radius, shadowy light in a 40-foot radius). These glowing weapons are quite obviously magical. Such a weapon can't be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Some of the specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Hardness and Hit Points:</strong> An attacker cannot damage a magic weapon that has an enhancement bonus unless his own weapon has at least as high an enhancement bonus as the weapon or shield struck. Each +1 of enhancement bonus also adds 1 to the weapon's or shield's hardness and hit points.</p>
<p><strong>Activation:</strong> Usually a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon--by attacking with it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate then the user usually needs to utter a command word (a standard action).</p>
<p><strong>Magic Weapons and Critical Hits:</strong> Some weapon qualities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit. This special effect functions against creatures not subject to critical hits, such as undead, elementals, and constructs. When fighting against such creatures, roll for critical hits as you would against humanoids or any other creature subject to critical hits. On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon's regular damage. </p>

<p><strong>Weapons for Unusually Sized Creatures:</strong> The cost of weapons for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium varies. The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.</p>
<p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> Roll d%. If the item is a melee weapon, a 01-30 result indicates that the item sheds light, 31-45 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon's function, and 46-100 indicates no special qualities. </p>
<p>If the item is a ranged weapon, a 01-15 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon's function, and 16-100 indicates no special qualities.</p>

<p>In addition to enhancement bonuses, weapons can have one or more of the special abilities detailed below. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Anarchic:</strong> An anarchic weapon is chaotically aligned and infused with the power of chaos. It makes the weapon chaos-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of lawful alignment. It bestows one negative level on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the chaotic power upon their ammunition.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation [chaotic]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, chaos hammer, creator must be chaotic; Price +2 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Axiomatic:</strong> An axiomatic weapon is lawfully aligned and infused with the power of law. It makes the weapon law-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of chaotic alignment. It bestows one negative level on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the lawful power upon their ammunition.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation [lawful]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, order's wrath, creator must be lawful; Price +2 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Bane:</strong> A bane weapon excels at attacking one type or subtype of creature. Against its designated foe, its effective enhancement bonus is +2 better than its normal enhancement bonus. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against the foe. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the bane quality upon their ammunition. To randomly determine a weapon's designated foe, roll on the following table.</p>

<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, summon monster I; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Brilliant Energy:</strong> A brilliant energy weapon has its significant portion transformed into light, although this does not modify the item's weight. It always gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A brilliant energy weapon ignores nonliving matter. Armor and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) A brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, and objects. This property can only be applied to melee weapons, thrown weapons, and ammunition.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, gaseous form, continual flame; Price +4 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Dancing:</strong> As a standard action, a dancing weapon can be loosed to attack on its own. It fights for 4 rounds using the base attack bonus of the one who loosed it and then drops. While dancing, it cannot make attacks of opportunity, and the person who activated it is not considered armed with the weapon. In all other respects, it is considered wielded or attended by the creature for all maneuvers and effects that target items. While dancing, it takes up the same space as the activating character and can attack adjacent foes (weapons with reach can attack opponents up to 10 feet away). The dancing weapon accompanies the person who activated it everywhere, whether she moves by physical or magical means. If the wielder who loosed it has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it while it is attacking on its own as a free action; when so retrieved the weapon can't dance (attack on its own) again for 4 rounds.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects; Price +4 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Defending:</strong> A defending weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the sword's enhancement bonus to his AC as a bonus that stacks with all others. As a free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon's enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon, and the effect to AC lasts until his next turn.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shield or shield of faith; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Disruption:</strong> A weapon of disruption is the bane of all undead. Any undead creature struck in combat must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be destroyed. A weapon of disruption must be a bludgeoning weapon. (If you roll this property randomly for a piercing or slashing weapon, reroll.)</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, heal; Price +2 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Distance:</strong> This property can only be placed on a ranged weapon. A weapon of distance has double the range increment of other weapons of its kind.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 6th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, clairaudience/clairvoyance; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Flaming:</strong> Upon command, a flaming weapon is sheathed in fire. The fire does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given. A flaming weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the fire energy upon their ammunition.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor and flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Flaming Burst:</strong> A flaming burst weapon functions as a flaming weapon that also explodes with flame upon striking a successful critical hit. The fire does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra fire damage from the flaming ability (see above), a flaming burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of fire damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of fire damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points of fire damage. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the fire energy upon their ammunition.</p>
<p>Even if the flaming ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra fire damage on a successful critical hit.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor and flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; Price +2 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Frost:</strong> Upon command, a frost weapon is sheathed in icy cold. The cold does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given. A frost weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the cold energy upon their ammunition.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, chill metal or ice storm; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Ghost Touch:</strong> A ghost touch weapon deals damage normally against incorporeal creatures, regardless of its bonus. (An incorporeal creature's 50% chance to avoid damage does not apply to attacks with ghost touch weapons.) The weapon can be picked up and moved by an incorporeal creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially, a ghost touch weapon counts as either corporeal or incorporeal at any given time, whichever is more beneficial to the wielder.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, plane shift; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Holy:</strong> A holy weapon is imbued with holy power. This power makes the weapon good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of evil alignment. It bestows one negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the holy power upon their ammunition.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation [good]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, holy smite, creator must be good; Price +2 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Icy Burst:</strong> An icy burst weapon functions as a frost weapon that also explodes with frost upon striking a successful critical hit. The frost does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra damage from the frost ability, an icy burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of cold damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of cold damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the cold energy upon their ammunition. </p>
<p>Even if the frost ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra cold damage on a successful critical hit.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, chill metal or ice storm; Price +2 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Keen:</strong> This ability doubles the threat range of a weapon. Only piercing or slashing weapons can be keen. (If you roll this property randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll.) This benefit doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon (such as the keen edge spell or the Improved Critical feat).</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, keen edge; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Ki Focus:</strong> The magic weapon serves as a channel for the wielder's ki, allowing her to use her special ki attacks through the weapon as if they were unarmed attacks. These attacks include the monk's stunning attack, ki strike, and quivering palm, as well as the Stunning Fist feat. Only melee weapons can have the ki focus ability.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be a monk; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Merciful:</strong> The weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage, and all damage it deals is nonlethal damage. On command, the weapon suppresses this ability until commanded to resume it. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the merciful effect upon their ammunition.</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, cure light wounds; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Mighty Cleaving:</strong> A mighty cleaving weapon allows a wielder with the Cleave feat to make one additional cleave attempt in a round.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, divine power; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Returning:</strong> This special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can be thrown. A returning weapon flies through the air back to the creature that threw it. It returns to the thrower just before the creature's next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn).</p>
<p>Catching a returning weapon when it comes back is a free action. If the character can't catch it, or if the character has moved since throwing it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, telekinesis; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Seeking:</strong> Only ranged weapons can have the seeking ability. The weapon veers toward its target, negating any miss chances that would otherwise apply, such as from concealment. (The wielder still has to aim the weapon at the right square. Arrows mistakenly shot into an empty space, for example, do not veer and hit invisible enemies, even if they are nearby.)</p>
<p>Strong divination; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, true seeing; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Shock:</strong> Upon command, a shock weapon is sheathed in crackling electricity. The electricity does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given. A shock weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the electricity energy upon their ammunition.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, call lightning or lightning bolt; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Shocking Burst:</strong> A shocking burst weapon functions as a shock weapon that also explodes with electricity upon striking a successful critical hit. The electricity does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra electricity damage from the shock ability, a shocking burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of electricity damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of electricity damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the electricity energy upon their ammunition.</p>
<p>Even if the shock ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra electricity damage on a successful critical hit.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, call lightning or lightning bolt; Price +2 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed:</strong> When making a full attack action, the wielder of a speed weapon may make one extra attack with it. The attack uses the wielder's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This benefit is not cumulative with similar effects, such as a haste spell.)</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, haste; Price +3 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Storing:</strong> A spell storing weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon. (The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action.) Any time the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. (This special ability is an exception to the general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least as long as casting that spell normally.) Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it. A randomly rolled spell storing weapon has a 50% chance to have a spell stored in it already.</p>
<p>Strong evocation (plus aura of stored spell); CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be a caster of at least 12th level; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Thundering:</strong> A thundering weapon creates a cacophonous roar like thunder upon striking a successful critical hit. The sonic energy does not harm the wielder. A thundering weapon deals an extra 1d8 points of sonic damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d8 points of sonic damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d8 points of sonic damage. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the sonic energy upon their ammunition. Subjects dealt a critical hit by a thundering weapon must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be deafened permanently.</p>
<p>Faint necromancy; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, blindness/deafness; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Throwing:</strong> This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A melee weapon crafted with this ability gains a range increment of 10 feet and can be thrown by a wielder proficient in its normal use.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, magic stone; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Unholy:</strong> An unholy weapon is imbued with unholy power. This power makes the weapon evil-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of good alignment. It bestows one negative level on any good creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the unholy power upon their ammunition.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation [evil]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, unholy blight, creator must be evil; Price +2 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Vicious:</strong> When a vicious weapon strikes an opponent, it creates a flash of disruptive energy that resonates between the opponent and the wielder. This energy deals an extra 2d6 points of damage to the opponent and 1d6 points of damage to the wielder. Only melee weapons can be vicious.</p>
<p>Moderate necromancy; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, enervation; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Vorpal:</strong> This potent and feared ability allows the weapon to sever the heads of those it strikes. Upon a roll of natural 20 (followed by a successful roll to confirm the critical hit), the weapon severs the opponent's head (if it has one) from its body. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no heads. Others, such as golems and undead creatures other than vampires, are not affected by the loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die when their heads are cut off. A vorpal weapon must be a slashing weapon. (If you roll this property randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll.)</p>
<p>Strong necromancy and transmutation; CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, circle of death, keen edge; Price +5 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Wounding:</strong> A wounding weapon deals 1 point of Constitution damage from blood loss when it hits a creature. A critical hit does not multiply the Constitution damage. Creatures immune to critical hits (such as plants and constructs) are immune to the Constitution damage dealt by this weapon.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, mage's sword; Price +2 bonus.</p>

<h2 id="specific-weapons"><a class="header" href="#specific-weapons">Specific Weapons</a></h2>
<p>The following specific weapons usually are preconstructed with exactly the qualities described here.</p>
<p><strong>Adamantine Battleaxe:</strong> This nonmagical axe is made out of adamantine. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.</p>
<p>No aura (nonmagical); Price 3,010 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Adamantine Dagger:</strong> This nonmagical dagger is made out of adamantine. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.</p>
<p>No aura (nonmagical); Price 3,002 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Assassin's Dagger:</strong> This wicked-looking, curved +2 dagger provides a +1 bonus to the DC of a Fortitude save forced by the death attack of an assassin.</p>
<p>Moderate necromancy; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, slay living; Price 18,302 gp; Cost 9,302 gp + 720 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Dagger of Venom:</strong> This black +1 dagger has a serrated edge. It allows the wielder to use a poison effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the poison effect must be invoked in the same round that the dagger strikes.</p>
<p>Faint necromancy; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, poison; Price 8,302 gp; Cost 4,302 gp + 320 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Dwarven Thrower:</strong> This weapon commonly functions as a +2 warhammer. In the hands of a dwarf, the warhammer gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus (for a total enhancement bonus of +3) and gains the returning special ability. It can be hurled with a 30-foot range increment. When hurled, it deals an extra 2d8 points of damage against giants or an extra 1d8 points of damage against any other target.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be a dwarf of at least 10th level; Price 60,312 gp; Cost 30,312 gp + 2,400 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Flame Tongue:</strong> This is a +1 flaming burst longsword. Once per day, the sword can blast forth a fiery ray at any target within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The ray deals 4d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, scorching ray, and flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; Price 20,715 gp; Cost 10,515 gp + 816 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Frost Brand:</strong> This +3 frost greatsword sheds light as a torch when the temperature drops below 0°F. At such times it cannot be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Its wielder is protected from fire; the sword absorbs the first 10 points of fire damage each round that the wielder would otherwise take.</p>
<p>A frost brand extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. As a standard action, it can also dispel lasting fire spells, but not instantaneous effects, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +14) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, ice storm, dispel magic, protection from energy; Price 54,475 gp; Cost 27,375 gp and 5 sp + 2179 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Holy Avenger:</strong> This +2 cold iron longsword becomes a +5 holy cold iron longsword in the hands of a paladin.</p>
<p>It provides spell resistance of 5 + the paladin's level to the wielder and anyone adjacent to her. It also enables the wielder to use greater dispel magic (once per round as a standard action) at the class level of the paladin. (Only the area dispel is possible, not the targeted dispel or counterspell versions of greater dispel magic.)</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, holy aura, creator must be good; Price 120,630 gp; Cost 60,630 gp + 4,800 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Javelin of Lightning:</strong> This javelin becomes a 5d6 lightning bolt when thrown (Reflex DC 14 half ). It is consumed in the attack.</p>
<p>Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, lightning bolt; Price 1,500 gp; Cost 750 gp + 30 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Life-Drinker:</strong> This +1 greataxe is favored by undead and constructs, who do not suffer its drawback. A life-drinker bestows two negative levels on its target whenever it deals damage, just as if its target had been struck by an undead creature. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose a character level.</p>
<p>Each time a life-drinker deals damage to a foe, it also bestows one negative level on the wielder. Any negative level gained by the wielder in this fashion lasts for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, enervation; Price 40,320 gp; Cost 20,320 gp + 1,600 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Luck Blade:</strong> This +2 short sword gives its possessor a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. Its possessor also gains the power of good fortune, usable once per day. This extraordinary ability allows its possessor to reroll one roll that she just made. She must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. In addition, a luck blade may contain up to three wishes (when randomly rolled, a luck blade holds 1d4-1 wishes, minimum 0). When the last wish is used, the sword remains a +2 short sword, still grants the +1 luck bonus, and still grants its reroll power.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 17th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, wish or miracle; Price 22,060 gp (0 wishes), 62,360 gp (1 wish), 102,660 gp (2 wishes), 142,960 gp (3 wishes); Cost 11,030 gp + 882 XP (0 wishes), 31,180 gp + 2,494 XP (1 wish); 51,330 gp + 4,106 XP (2 wishes), 71,480 gp + 5,718 XP (3 wishes).</p>
<p><strong>Mace of Smiting:</strong> This +3 adamantine heavy mace has a +5 enhancement bonus against constructs, and any critical hit dealt to a construct completely destroys it (no saving throw). A critical hit dealt to an outsider deals x4 damage rather than x2.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, disintegrate; Price 75,312 gp; Cost 39,312 gp + 2,880 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Mace of Terror:</strong> On command, this +2 heavy mace causes the wielder's clothes and appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror such that living creatures in a 30-foot cone become panicked as if by a fear spell (Will DC 16 partial). They take a -2 morale penalty on saving throws, and they flee from the wielder. The wielder may use this ability up to three times per day. </p>
<p>Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, fear; Price 38,552 gp; Cost 19,276 gp + 1,542 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Masterwork Cold Iron Longsword:</strong> This nonmagical longsword is crafted out of cold iron. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.</p>
<p>No aura (nonmagical); Price 330 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Nine Lives Stealer:</strong> This longsword always performs as a +2 longsword, but it also has the power to draw the life force from an opponent. It can do this nine times before the ability is lost. At that point, the sword becomes a simple +2 longsword (with a hint of evil about it). A critical hit must be dealt for the sword's death-dealing ability to function, and this weapon has no effect on creatures not subject to critical hits. The victim is entitled to a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid death. If the save is successful, the sword's death-dealing ability does not function, no use of the ability is expended, and normal critical damage is determined. This sword is evil, and any good character attempting to wield it gains two negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the sword is in hand and disappear when the sword is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the sword is wielded.</p>
<p>Strong necromancy [evil]; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, finger of death; Price 23,057 gp; Cost 11,528 gp 5 sp + 922 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Oathbow:</strong> Of elven make, this white +2 composite longbow (+2 Str bonus) whispers &quot;Swift defeat to my enemies&quot; in Elven when nocked and pulled. Once per day, if the firer swears aloud to slay her target (a free action), the bow's whisper becomes the low shout &quot;Swift death to those who have wronged me.&quot; Against such a sworn enemy, the bow has a +5 enhancement bonus, and arrows launched from it deal an additional 2d6 points of damage (and x4 on a critical hit instead of the normal x3). However, the bow is treated as only a masterwork weapon against all foes other than the sworn enemy, and the wielder takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls with any weapon other than the oathbow. These bonuses and penalties last for seven days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder of the oathbow, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>The oathbow may only have one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a target, he cannot make a new oath until he has slain that target or seven days have passed. Even if the wielder slays the sworn enemy on the same day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate the oathbow's special power again until 24 hours have passed from the time he made the oath.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be an elf; Price 25,600 gp; Cost 13,100 gp + 1,000 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Rapier of Puncturing:</strong> Three times per day, this +2 wounding rapier allows the wielder to make a touch attack with the weapon that deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage by draining blood. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the Constitution damage dealt by this weapon.</p>
<p>Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, harm; Price 50,320 gp; Cost 25,320 gp + 2,000 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Screaming Bolt:</strong> One of these +2 bolts screams when fired, forcing all enemies of the wielder within 20 feet of the path of the bolt to succeed on a DC 14 Will save or become shaken. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
<p>Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, doom; Price 267gp; Cost 128 gp and 5 sp + 10 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Shatterspike:</strong> Wielders without the Improved Sunder feat use Shatterspike as a +1 longsword only; wielders with the Improved Sunder feat add a +4 bonus (including the sword's +1 enhancement bonus) to the opposed roll when attempting to strike a foe's weapon. If successful, Shatterspike deals 1d8+4 points of damage plus the wielder's Strength modifier to the target weapon (the target weapon's hardness must still be overcome with each hit). Shatterspike can damage weapons with an enhancement bonus of +4 or lower.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 13th; Str 13, Craft Arms and Armor, Power Attack, Improved Sunder, shatter; Price 4,315 gp; Cost 2,315 gp + 160 XP; Weight 4 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Shifter's Sorrow:</strong> This +1/+1 two-bladed sword has blades of alchemical silver. The weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against any creature with the shapechanger subtype. When a shapechanger or a creature in an alternate form (such as a druid using wild shape) is struck by the weapon, it must make a DC 15 Will save or return to its natural form.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Arms and Armor, baleful polymorph; Price 12,780 gp; Cost 6,780 gp + 480 XP; Weight 10 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Silver Dagger, Masterwork:</strong> This masterwork alchemical silver dagger is nonmagical. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.</p>
<p>No aura (nonmagical); Price 322 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Slaying Arrow:</strong> This +1 arrow is keyed to a particular type or subtype of creature. If it strikes such a creature, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or die (or, in the case of unliving targets, be destroyed) instantly. Note that even creatures normally exempt from Fortitude saves (undead and constructs) are subject to this attack. When keyed to a living creature, this is a death effect (and thus death ward protects a target). To determine the type or subtype of creature the arrow is keyed to, roll on the table below.</p>
<p>A greater slaying arrow functions just like a normal slaying arrow, but the DC to avoid the death effect is 23.</p>
<p>Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, finger of death (slaying arrow) or heightened finger of death (greater slaying arrow); Price 2,282 gp (slaying arrow) or 4,057 gp (greater slaying arrow); Cost 1,144 gp 5 sp + 91 XP (slaying arrow) or 2,032 gp + 162 XP (greater slaying arrow).</p>

<p><strong>Sleep Arrow:</strong> This +1 arrow is painted white and has white fletching. If it strikes a foe so that it would normally deal damage, it instead bursts into magical energy that deals nonlethal damage (in the same amount as would be lethal damage) and forces the target to make a DC 11 Will save or fall asleep.</p>
<p>Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, sleep; Price 132 gp; Cost 69 gp 5 sp + 5 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Sun Blade:</strong> This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a sun blade is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. (In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword.) Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack.</p>
<p>In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 bastard sword. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and x3 on a critical hit instead of the usual x2).</p>
<p>The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above her head while speaking a command word. The sunblade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that is like full daylight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the sword is wielded.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, daylight, creator must be good; Price 50,335 gp; Cost 25,335 gp + 2,000 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Sword of Life Stealing:</strong> This black iron +2 longsword bestows a negative level when it deals a critical hit. The sword wielder gains 1d6 temporary hit points each time a negative level is bestowed on another. These temporary hit points last for 24 hours. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose a character level.</p>
<p>Strong necromancy; CL 17th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, enervation; Price 25,715 gp; Cost 12,857 gp and 5 sp + 1,029 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Sword of the Planes:</strong> This longsword has an enhancement bonus of +1 on the Material Plane, but on any Elemental Plane its enhancement bonus increases to +2. (The +2 enhancement bonus also applies on the Material Plane when the weapon is used against elementals.) It operates as a +3 longsword on the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane or when used against opponents native to either of those planes. On any other plane, or against any outsider, it functions as a +4 longsword.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, plane shift; Price 22,315 gp; Cost 11,157 gp and 5 sp + 893 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Sword of Subtlety:</strong> A +1 short sword with a thin, dull gray blade, this weapon provides a +4 bonus on its wielder's attack and damage rolls when he is making a sneak attack with it.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, blur; Price 22,310 gp; Cost 11,155 gp + 892 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Sylvan Scimitar:</strong> This +3 scimitar, when used outdoors in a temperate climate, grants its wielder the use of the Cleave feat and deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, divine power or creator must be a 7th-level druid; Price 47,315gp; Cost 23,657 gp and 5 sp + 1,893 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Trident of Fish Command:</strong> The magical properties of this +1 trident with a 6-foot-long haft enable its wielder to charm up to 14 HD of aquatic animals (Will DC 16 negates, animals get a +5 bonus if currently under attack by the wielder or his allies), no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. The wielder can use this effect up to three times per day. The wielder can communicate with the animals as if using a speak with animals spell. Animals making their saving throw are free of control, but they will not approach within 10 feet of the trident. The trident can be used up to three times per day.</p>
<p>Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, speak with animals; Price 18,650 gp; Cost 9,325 gp + 746 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Trident of Warning:</strong> A weapon of this type enables its wielder to determine the location, depth, kind, and number of aquatic predators within 680 feet. A trident of warning must be grasped and pointed in order for the character using it to gain such information, and it requires 1 round to scan a hemisphere with a radius of 680 feet. The weapon is otherwise a +2 trident.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, locate creature; Price 10,115 gp; Cost 5,057 gp and 5 sp + 405 XP.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="magic-armor"><a class="header" href="#magic-armor">Magic Armor</a></h1>
<p>In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than nonmagical armor. Magic armor bonuses are enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and stack with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield enhancement bonuses). All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check penalties by 1.</p>
<p>In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. A suit of armor cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A suit of armor with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
<p>A suit of armor or a shield may be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01-95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96-100 indicates that it is made of a special material.</p>
<p>Armor is always created so that even if the type of armor comes with boots or gauntlets, these pieces can be switched for other magic boots or gauntlets.</p>

<p>| All magic shields are masterwork shields (with an armor check penalty 1 less than normal). | |  |</p>
<p><strong>Caster Level for Armor and Shields:</strong> The caster level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>
<p><strong>Shields:</strong> Shield enhancement bonuses stack with armor enhancement bonuses. Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as attack or damage bonuses when the shield is used in a bash. The bashing special ability, however, does grant a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls (see the special ability description).</p>
<p>A shield could be built that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to AC.</p>
<p>As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not improve AC. A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Shield Hardness and Hit Points:</strong> Each +1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to a shield's hardness and +10 to its hit points.</p>
<p><strong>Activation:</strong> Usually a character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields--by wearing them. If armor or a shield has a special ability that the user needs to activate then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a standard action).</p>
<p><strong>Armor for Unusual Creatures:</strong> The cost of armor for nonhumanoid creatures, as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies. The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.</p>
<h2 id="magic-armor-and-shield-special-ability-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#magic-armor-and-shield-special-ability-descriptions">Magic Armor and Shield Special Ability Descriptions</a></h2>
<p>Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have one or more of the special abilities detailed below. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Acid Resistance:</strong> A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a dull gray appearance. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of acid damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Acid Resistance, Improved:</strong> As acid resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of acid damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Acid Resistance, Greater:</strong> As acid resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of acid damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Animated:</strong> Upon command, an animated shield floats within 2 feet of the wielder, protecting her as if she were using it herself but freeing up both her hands. Only one shield can protect a character at a time. A character with an animated shield still takes any penalties associated with shield use, such as armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, and nonproficiency.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects; Price +2 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Arrow Catching:</strong> A shield with this ability attracts ranged weapons to it. It has a deflection bonus of +1 against ranged weapons because projectiles and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon aimed at a target within 5 feet of the shield's wearer diverts from its original target and targets the shield's bearer instead. (If the wielder has total cover relative to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted.) Additionally, those attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that would normally apply. Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher than the shield's base AC bonus are not diverted to the wearer (but the shield's increased AC bonus still applies against these weapons). The wielder can activate or deactivate this ability with a command word.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, entropic shield; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Arrow Deflection:</strong> This shield protects the wielder as if he had the Deflect Arrows feat. Once per round when he would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he can make a DC 20 Reflex save. If the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. He must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or acid arrows, can't be deflected.</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shield; Price +2 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Bashing:</strong> A shield with this special ability is designed to perform a shield bash. A bashing shield deals damage as if it were a weapon of two size categories larger (a Medium light shield thus deals 1d6 points of damage and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d8 points of damage). The shield acts as a +1 weapon when used to bash. (Only light and heavy shields can have this ability.)</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bull's strength; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Blinding:</strong> A shield with this ability flashes with a brilliant light up to twice per day upon command of the wielder. Anyone within 20 feet except the wielder must make a DC 14 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, searing light; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Resistance:</strong> A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a bluish, icy hue or is adorned with furs and shaggy pelts. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of cold damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Resistance, Improved:</strong> As cold resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of cold damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Resistance, Greater:</strong> As cold resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of cold damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Electricity Resistance:</strong> A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a bluish hue and often bears a storm or lightning motif. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of electricity damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Electricity Resistance, Improved:</strong> As electricity resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of electricity damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Electricity Resistance, Greater:</strong> As electricity resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of electricity damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Etherealness:</strong> On command, this ability allows the wearer of the armor to become ethereal (as the ethereal jaunt spell) once per day. The character can remain ethereal for as long as desired, but once he returns to normal, he cannot become ethereal again that day.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, ethereal jaunt; Price +49,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Resistance:</strong> A suit of armor with this ability normally has a reddish hue and often is decorated with a draconic motif. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of fire damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Resistance, Improved:</strong> As fire resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of fire damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Resistance, Greater:</strong> As fire resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of fire damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Fortification:</strong> This suit of armor or shield produces a magical force that protects vital areas of the wearer more effectively. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the wearer, there is a chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.</p>
<p>| Fortification Type | | Chance for Normal Damage | | Base Price Modifier | |  |
| Light | | 25% | | +1 bonus | |  |
| Moderate | | 75% | | +3 bonus | |  |
| Heavy | | 100% | | +5 bonus | |  |</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, limited wish or miracle; Price varies (see above).</p>
<p><strong>Ghost Touch:</strong> This armor or shield seems almost translucent. Both its enhancement bonus and its armor bonus count against the attacks of incorporeal creatures. It can be picked up, moved, and worn by incorporeal creatures at any time. Incorporeal creatures gain the armor or shield's enhancement bonus against both corporeal and incorporeal attacks, and they can still pass freely through solid objects.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, etherealness; Price +3 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Glamered:</strong> A suit of armor with this ability appears normal. Upon command, the armor changes shape and form to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing. The armor retains all its properties (including weight) when glamered. Only a true seeing spell or similar magic reveals the true nature of the armor when disguised.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, disguise self; Price +2,700 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Invulnerability:</strong> This suit of armor grants the wearer damage reduction of 5/magic.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration and perhaps evocation (if miracle is used); CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, stoneskin, wish or miracle; Price +3 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Reflecting:</strong> This shield seems like a mirror. Its surface is completely reflective. Once per day, it can be called on to reflect a spell back at its caster exactly like the spell turning spell.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, spell turning; Price +5 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow:</strong> This armor is jet black and blurs the wearer whenever she tries to hide, granting a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks. (The armor's armor check penalty still applies normally.)</p>

<p><strong>Shadow, Improved:</strong> As shadow, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Hide checks.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow, Greater:</strong> As shadow, except it grants a +15 competence bonus on Hide checks.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, invisibility; Price +33,750 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Silent Moves:</strong> This armor is well oiled and magically constructed so that it not only makes little sound, but it dampens sound around it. It provides a +5 competence bonus on its wearer's Move Silently checks. (The armor's armor check penalty still applies normally.)</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, silence; Price +3,750 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Silent Moves, Improved:</strong> As silent moves, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Move Silently checks.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, silence; Price +15,000 gp.</p>

<p>Moderate illusion; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, silence; Price +33,750 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Slick:</strong> Slick armor seems coated at all times with a slightly greasy oil. It provides a +5 competence bonus on its wearer's Escape Artist checks. (The armor's armor check penalty still applies normally.)</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 4th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, grease; Price +3,750 gp.</p>

<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, grease; Price +33,750 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Sonic Resistance:</strong> A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a glistening appearance. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of sonic damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Sonic Resistance, Improved:</strong> As sonic resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of sonic damage per attack.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.</p>

<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> This property grants the armor's wearer spell resistance while the armor is worn. The spell resistance can be 13, 15, 17, or 19, depending on the armor.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, spell resistance; Price +2 bonus (SR 13), +3 bonus (SR 15), +4 bonus (SR 17), or +5 bonus (SR 19).</p>
<p><strong>Undead Controlling:</strong> The wearer of a suit of armor or a shield with this property may control up to 26 HD of undead per day, as the control undead spell. At dawn each day, the wearer loses control of any undead still under his sway. Armor or a shield with this ability appears to be made of bone; this feature is entirely decorative and has no other effect on the armor.</p>
<p>Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, control undead; Price +49,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Wild:</strong> The wearer of a suit of armor or a shield with this ability preserves his armor bonus (and any enhancement bonus) while in a wild shape. Armor and shields with this ability usually appear to be made covered in leaf patterns. While the wearer is in a wild shape, the armor cannot be seen.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, baleful polymorph; Price +3 bonus.</p>

<p>No aura (nonmagical); Price 10,200 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Banded Mail of Luck:</strong> Ten 100-gp gems adorn this +3 banded mail. Once per week, the armor allows its wearer to require that an attack roll made against him be rerolled.

<p>Strong enchantment; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bless; Price 18,900 gp; Cost 10,150 gp + 700 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Breastplate of Command:</strong> This finely crafted +2 breastplate radiates a powerful aura of magic. When worn, the armor bestows a dignified and commanding aura upon its owner. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma checks, including turning checks and Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus to his Leadership score. Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal. Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the armor, the wearer cannot hide or conceal herself in any way and still have the effect function.</p>
<p>Strong enchantment; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, mass charm monster; Price 25,400 gp; Cost 10,975 gp + 850 XP.</p>

<p><strong>Demon Armor:</strong> This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon. The helmet is shaped to look like a horned demon head, and its wearer looks out of the open, tooth-filled mouth. This +4 full plate allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a contagion spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The &quot;claws&quot; are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets. </p>
<p>The armor bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. The negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the armor is worn.</p>
<p>Strong necromancy [evil]; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, contagion; Price 52,260 gp; Cost 26,130 gp + 2,090 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Dragonhide Plate:</strong> This suit of full plate is made of dragonhide, rather than metal, so druids can wear it. It is otherwise identical to masterwork full plate.</p>

<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, haste; Price 26,500 gp.</p>

<p>The following specific shields usually are preconstructed with exactly the qualities described here.</p>
<p><strong>Absorbing Shield:</strong> This +1 heavy steel shield is flat black and seems to absorb light. Once every two days, on command, it can disintegrate an object that it touches, as the spell but requiring a melee touch attack.</p>

<p><strong>Caster's Shield:</strong> This +1 light wooden shield has a small leather strip on the back on which a spellcaster can scribe a single spell as on a scroll.

The strip is reusable.</p>
<p>A random caster's shield has a 50% chance of having a single medium scroll spell on it. The spell is divine (01-80 on d%) or arcane (81-100).</p>

<p>MAGIC ITEMS III (POTIONS, RINGS, &amp; RODS)</p>
<p>POTIONS AND OILS</p>
<p>A potion is a magic liquid that produces its effect when imbibed. Magic oils are similar to potions, except that oils are applied externally rather than imbibed. A potion or oil can be used only once. It can duplicate the effect of a spell of up to 3rd level that has a casting time of less than 1 minute.</p>
<p>Potions are like spells cast upon the imbiber. The character taking the potion doesn't get to make any decisions about the effect --the caster who brewed the potion has already done so. The drinker of a potion is both the effective target and the caster of the effect (though the potion indicates the caster level, the drinker still controls the effect).</p>
<p>The person applying an oil is the effective caster, but the object is the target.</p>
<p>Physical Description: A typical potion or oil consists of 1 ounce of liquid held in a ceramic or glass vial fitted with a tight stopper. The stoppered container is usually no more than 1 inch wide and 2 inches high. The vial has AC 13, 1 hit point, hardness 1, and a break DC of 12. Vials hold 1 ounce of liquid.</p>
<p>Identifying Potions: In addition to the standard methods of identification, PCs can sample from each container they find to attempt to determine the nature of the liquid inside. An experienced character learns to identify potions by memory</p>
<p>--for example, the last time she tasted a liquid that reminded her of almonds, it turned out to be a potion of cure moderate wounds. </p>
<p>Activation: Drinking a potion or applying an oil requires no special skill. The user merely removes the stopper and swallows the potion or smears on the oil. The following rules govern potion and oil use.</p>
<p>Drinking a potion or using an oil on an item of gear is a standard action. The potion or oil takes effect immediately. Using a potion or oil provokes attacks of opportunity. A successful attack (including grappling attacks) against the character forces a Concentration check (as for casting a spell). If the character fails this check, she cannot drink the potion. An enemy may direct an attack of opportunity against the potion or oil container rather than against the character. A successful attack of this sort can destroy the container. </p>
<p>A creature must be able to swallow a potion or smear on an oil. Because of this, incorporeal creatures cannot use potions or oils. </p>
<p>Any corporeal creature can imbibe a potion. The potion must be swallowed. Any corporeal creature can use an oil.</p>
<p>A character can carefully administer a potion to an unconscious creature as a full-round action, trickling the liquid down the creature's throat. Likewise, it takes a full-round action to apply an oil to an unconscious creature.</p>
<p>Potion Descriptions</p>
<p>The caster level for a standard potion is the minimum caster level needed to cast the spell (unless otherwise specified).</p>

<p>MAGIC ITEMS IV (SCROLLS, STAFFS, &amp; WANDS)</p>
<p>SCROLLS</p>
<p>A scroll is a spell (or collection of spells) that has been stored in written form. A spell on a scroll can be used only once. The writing vanishes from the scroll when the spell is activated. Using a scroll is basically like casting a spell.</p>
<p>Physical Description: A scroll is a heavy sheet of fine vellum or high-quality paper. An area about 8 1/2 inches wide and 11 inches long is sufficient to hold one spell. The sheet is reinforced at the top and bottom with strips of leather slightly longer than the sheet is wide. A scroll holding more than one spell has the same width (about 8 1/2 inches) but is an extra foot or so long for each extra spell. Scrolls that hold three or more spells are usually fitted with reinforcing rods at each end rather than simple strips of leather. A scroll has AC 9, 1 hit point, hardness 0, and a break DC of 8.</p>
<p>To protect it from wrinkling or tearing, a scroll is rolled up from both ends to form a double cylinder. (This also helps the user unroll the scroll quickly.) The scroll is placed in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. Most scroll cases are inscribed with magic symbols which often identify the owner or the spells stored on the scrolls inside. The symbols often hide magic traps.</p>
<p>Activation: To activate a scroll, a spellcaster must read the spell written on it. Doing so involves several steps and conditions.</p>
<p>Decipher the Writing: The writing on a scroll must be deciphered before a character can use it or know exactly what spell it contains. This requires a read magic spell or a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level). </p>
<p>Deciphering a scroll to determine its contents does not activate its magic unless it is a specially prepared cursed scroll. A character can decipher the writing on a scroll in advance so that he or she can proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use the scroll.</p>
<p>Activate the Spell: Activating a scroll requires reading the spell from the scroll. The character must be able to see and read the writing on the scroll. Activating a scroll spell requires no material components or focus. (The creator of the scroll provided these when scribing the scroll.) Note that some spells are effective only when cast on an item or items. In such a case, the scroll user must provide the item when activating the spell. Activating a scroll spell is subject to disruption just as casting a normally prepared spell would be. Using a scroll is like casting a spell for purposes of arcane spell failure chance.</p>
<p>To have any chance of activating a scroll spell, the scroll user must meet the following requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The spell must be of the correct type (arcane or divine). Arcane spellcasters (wizards, sorcerers, and bards) can only use scrolls containing arcane spells, and divine spellcasters (clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers) can only use scrolls containing divine spells. (The type of scroll a character creates is also determined by his or her class.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user must have the spell on his or her class list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user must have the requisite ability score.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user meets all the requirements noted above, and her caster level is at least equal to the spell's caster level, she can automatically activate the spell without a check. If she meets all three requirements but her own caster level is lower than the scroll spell's caster level, then she has to make a caster level check (DC = scroll's caster level + 1) to cast the spell successfully. If she fails, she must make a DC 5 Wisdom check to avoid a mishap (see Scroll Mishaps, below). A natural roll of 1 always fails, whatever the modifiers.</p>
<p>Determine Effect: A spell successfully activated from a scroll works exactly like a spell prepared and cast the normal way. Assume the scroll spell's caster level is always the minimum level required to cast the spell for the character who scribed the scroll (usually twice the spell's level, minus 1), unless the caster specifically desires otherwise. </p>
<p>The writing for an activated spell disappears from the scroll.</p>
<p>Scroll Mishaps: When a mishap occurs, the spell on the scroll has a reversed or harmful effect. Possible mishaps are given below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A surge of uncontrolled magical energy deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level to the scroll user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spell strikes the scroll user or an ally instead of the intended target, or a random target nearby if the scroll user was the intended recipient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spell takes effect at some random location within spell range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spell's effect on the target is contrary to the spell's normal effect. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scroll user suffers some minor but bizarre effect related to the spell in some way. Most such effects should last only as long as the original spell's duration, or 2d10 minutes for instantaneous spells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some innocuous item or items appear in the spell's area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spell has delayed effect. Sometime within the next 1d12 hours, the spell activates. If the scroll user was the intended recipient, the spell takes effect normally. If the user was not the intended recipient, the spell goes off in the general direction of the original recipient or target, up to the spell's maximum range, if the target has moved away.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Several arcane spells are different in level for sorcerers and wizards than they are for bards. Such spells appear on the table at the level appropriate to a sorcerer or wizard (considered the default because bards typically don't involve themselves</p>
<p>in scribing scrolls).</p>
<p>Likewise, some divine spells are different in level for clerics and druids than they are for paladins and rangers. Such spells appear at the level appropriate to a cleric or druid (considered the default because paladins and rangers typically don't involve themselves in scribing scrolls). </p>
<p>If a divine spell is cast at different levels by clerics and druids, it appears at the level appropriate to a cleric (considered the default choice between clerics and druids).</p>
<p>Many spells are either arcane or divine, depending on the class of the caster. Such spells appear on both lists at the level appropriate to the class of the arcane or divine caster.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>WANDS</p>
<p>A wand is a thin baton that contains a single spell of 4th level or lower. Each wand has 50 charges when created, and each charge expended allows the user to use the wand's spell one time. A wand that runs out of charges is just a stick.</p>
<p>Physical Description: A typical wand is 6 inches to 12 inches long and about 1/4 inch thick, and often weighs no more than 1 ounce. Most wands are wood, but some are bone. A rare few are metal, glass, or even ceramic, but these are quite exotic. Occasionally, a wand has a gem or some device at its tip, and most are decorated with carvings or runes. A typical wand has AC 7, 5 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 16.</p>
<p>Activation: Wands use the spell trigger activation method, so casting a spell from a wand is usually a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the spell being cast, however, has a longer casting time than 1 action, it takes that long to cast the spell from a wand.) To activate a wand, a character must hold it in hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for nonhumanoid creatures) and point it in the general direction of the target or area. A wand may be used while grappling or while swallowed whole.</p>
<p>Special Qualities: Roll d%. A 01-30 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the wand's function, and 31-100 indicates no special qualities.</p>

<p>Wand Descriptions</p>
<p>All wands are simply storage devices for spells and thus have no special descriptions. Refer to the spell descriptions for all pertinent details.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>STAFFS</p>
<p>A staff is a long shaft of wood that stores several spells. Unlike wands, which can contain a wide variety of spells, each staff is of a certain kind and holds specific spells. A staff has 50 charges when created.</p>
<p>Physical Description: A typical staff is 4 feet to 7 feet long and 2 inches to 3 inches thick, weighing about 5 pounds. Most staffs are wood, but a rare few are bone, metal, or even glass. (These are extremely exotic.) Staffs often have a gem or some device at their tip or are shod in metal at one or both ends. Staffs are often decorated with carvings or runes. A typical staff is like a walking stick, quarterstaff, or cudgel. It has AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 24.</p>
<p>Activation: Staffs use the spell trigger activation method, so casting a spell from a staff is usually a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the spell being cast, however, has a longer casting time than 1 standard action, it takes that long to cast the spell from a staff.) To activate a staff, a character must hold it forth in at least one hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for nonhumanoid creatures).</p>
<p>Special Qualities: Roll d%. A 01-30 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the staff 's function, and 31-100 indicates no special qualities.</p>

<p>Staff Descriptions</p>
<p>Staffs use the wielder's ability score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against their spells. Unlike with other sorts of magic items, the wielder can use his caster level when activating the power of a staff if it's higher than the caster level of the staff. </p>
<p>This means that staffs are far more potent in the hands of a powerful spellcaster. Because they use the wielder's ability score to set the save DC for the spell, spells from a staff are often harder to resist than ones from other magic items, which use the minimum ability score required to cast the spell.  Not only are aspects of the spell dependant on caster level (range, duration, and so on) potentially higher, but spells from a staff are harder to dispel and have a better chance of overcoming a target's spell resistance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a staff can hold a spell of any level, unlike a wand, which is limited to spells of 4th level or lower. The minimum caster level of a staff is 8th. Standard staffs are described below.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Globe of invulnerability (2 charges)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The wielder of a staff of power gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and saving throws. The staff is also a +2 quarterstaff, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the staff causes double damage (x3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.</p>
<p>A staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot radius. All within 2 squares of the broken staff take points of damage equal to 8 x the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take 6 x the number of charges in damage, and those 5 or 6 squares distant take 4 x the number of charges in damage. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.</p>
<p>The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him. Only certain items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of power, are capable of being used for a retributive strike.</p>
<p>After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +2 quarterstaff. (Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a retributive strike.)</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>RODS</p>
<p>Rods are scepterlike devices that have unique magical powers and do not usually have charges. Anyone can use a rod.</p>
<p>Physical Description: Rods weigh approximately 5 pounds.</p>
<p>They range from 2 feet to 3 feet long and are usually made of iron or some other metal. (Many, as noted in their descriptions, can function as light maces or clubs due to their sturdy construction.)</p>
<p>These sturdy items have AC 9, 10 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 27.</p>
<p>Activation: Details relating to rod use vary from item to item. See the individual descriptions for specifics.</p>
<p>Special Qualities: Roll d%. A 01 result indicates the rod is intelligent, 02-31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32-100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes.</p>
<p>Rods with charges can never be intelligent.</p>

<p>Rod Descriptions</p>
<p>Although all rods are generally scepterlike, their configurations and abilities run the magical gamut. Standard rods are described below.</p>
<p>Absorption: This rod acts as a magnet, drawing spells or spell-like abilities into itself. The magic absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character possessing the rod or her gear. The rod then nullifies the spell's effect and stores its potential until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of her own. She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time.</p>
<p>A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared, without expending the preparation itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in hand when casting. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know.</p>
<p>A rod of absorption absorbs a maximum of fifty spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy.</p>
<p>To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: On a result of 71-100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 15th;Craft Rod, spell turning; Price 50,000 gp.</p>
<p>Alertness: This rod is indistinguishable from a +1 light mace. It has eight flanges on its macelike head. The rod bestows a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks. If grasped firmly, the rod enables the holder to use detect evil, detect good, detect chaos, detect law, detect magic, discern lies, light, or see invisibility. Each different use is a standard action.</p>
<p>If the head of a rod of alertness is planted in the ground, and the possessor wills it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any creature within 120 feet who intends to harm the possessor. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a prayer spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of possible danger from the unfriendly creature or creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10 minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an animate objects spell, utilizing any eleven (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a 5-foot-radius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground. Objects remain animated for 11 rounds. The rod can perform this function once per day.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration, divination, enchantment, and evocation; CL 11th; Craft Rod, alarm, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, discern lies, light, see invisibility, prayer, animate objects; Price 85,000 gp.</p>
<p>Cancellation: This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. The item touched must make a DC 23 Will save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a creature is holding it at the time, then the item can use the holder's Will save bonus in place of its own if the holder's is better. In such cases, contact is made by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by wish or miracle. (If a sphere of annihilation and a rod of cancellation negate each other, nothing can restore either of them.)</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 17th; Craft Rod, mage's disjunction; Price 11,000 gp.</p>
<p>Enemy Detection: This device pulses in the wielder's hand and points in the direction of any creature or creatures hostile to the bearer of the device (nearest ones first). These creatures can be invisible, ethereal, hidden, disguised, or in plain sight. Detection range is 60 feet. If the bearer of the rod concentrates for a full round, the rod pinpoints the location of the nearest enemy and indicates how many enemies are within range. The rod can be used three times each day, each use lasting up to 10 minutes. Activating the rod is a standard action.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 10th; Craft Rod, true seeing; Price 23,500 gp.</p>
<p>Flailing: Upon the command of its possessor, the rod activates, changing from a normal-seeming rod to a +3 dire flail. The dire flail is a double weapon, which means that each of the weapon's heads can be used to attack. The wielder can gain an extra attack (with the second head) at the cost of making all attacks at a -2 penalty (as if she had the Two-Weapon Fighting feat).</p>
<p>Once per day the wielder can use a free action to cause the rod to grant her a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws for 10 minutes. The rod need not be in weapon form to grant this benefit.</p>
<p>Transforming it into a weapon or back into a rod is a move action.</p>
<p>Moderate enchantment; CL 9th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bless; Price 50,000 gp.</p>
<p>Flame Extinguishing: This rod can extinguish Medium or smaller nonmagical fires with simply a touch (a standard action). For the rod to be effective against other sorts of fires, the wielder must expend 1 or more of the rod's charges.</p>
<p>Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire, or a magic fire of Medium or smaller (such as that of a flaming weapon or a burning hands spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those of a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell.</p>
<p>When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by fireball, flame strike, or wall of fire, extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod.</p>
<p>If the device is used upon a fire creature (a melee touch attack), it deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges.</p>
<p>A rod of flame extinguishing has 10 charges when found. Spent charges are renewed every day, so that a wielder can expend up to 10 charges in any 24-hour period.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Rod, pyrotechnics; Price 15,000 gp.</p>
<p>Immovable Rod: This rod is a flat iron bar with a small button on one end. When the button is pushed (a move action), the rod does not move from where it is, even if staying in place defies gravity. Thus, the owner can lift or place the rod wherever he wishes, push the button, and let go. Several immovable rods can even make a ladder when used together (although only two are needed). An immovable rod can support up to 8,000 pounds before falling to the ground. If a creature pushes against an immovable rod, it must make a DC 30 Strength check to move the rod up to 10 feet in a single round.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Rod, levitate; Price 5,000 gp.</p>
<p>Lordly Might: This rod has functions that are spell-like, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts. It also has several more mundane uses. The rod of lordly might is metal, thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. (Pushing any of the rod's buttons is equivalent to drawing a weapon.) It weighs 10 pounds.</p>
<p>The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hold person upon touch, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power and then succeed on a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fear upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half ) and cure the wielder of a like amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with hold person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following weapon functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +2 light mace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +1 flaming longsword. A blade springs from the ball, with the ball itself becoming the sword's hilt. The weapon lengthens to an overall length of 4 feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 battleaxe. A wide blade springs forth at the ball, and the whole lengthens to 4 feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 shortspear or +3 longspear. The spear blade springs forth, and the handle can be lengthened up to 12 feet (wielder's choice), for an overall length of from 6 feet to 15 feet. At its 15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Climbing pole/ladder. When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars three inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the pole by pushing button 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength modifier of +12.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder a knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Strong enchantment, evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; CL 19th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, inflict light wounds, bull's strength, flame blade, hold person, fear; Price 70,000 gp.</p>
<p>Metal and Mineral Detection: This rod pulses in the wielder's hand and points to the largest mass of metal within 30 feet. However, the wielder can concentrate on a specific metal or mineral. If the specific mineral is within 30 feet, the rod points to any places it is located, and the rod wielder knows the approximate quantity as well. If more than one deposit of the specified metal or mineral is within range, the rod points to the largest cache first. Each operation requires a full-round action.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 9th; Craft Rod, locate object; Price 10,500 gp.</p>
<p>Metamagic Rods: Metamagic rods hold the essence of a metamagic feat but do not change the spell slot of the altered spell. All the rods described here are use-activated (but casting spells in a threatened area still draws an attack of opportunity). A caster may only use one metamagic rod on any given spell, but it is permissible to combine a rod with metamagic feats possessed by the rod's wielder. In this case, only the feats possessed by the wielder adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast.</p>
<p>Possession of a metamagic rod does not confer the associated feat on the owner, only the ability to use the given feat a specified number of times per day. A sorcerer still must take a full-round action when using a metamagic rod, just as if using a metamagic feat he possesses.</p>
<p>Lesser and Greater Metamagic Rods: Normal metamagic rods can be used with spells of 6th level or lower. Lesser rods can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower, while greater rods can be used with spells of 9th level or lower.</p>
<p>Metamagic, Empower: The wielder can cast up to three spells per day that are empowered as though using the Empower Spell feat.</p>
<p>Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Empower Spell; Price 9,000 gp (lesser), 32,500 gp (normal), 73,000 gp (greater).</p>
<p>Metamagic, Enlarge: The wielder can cast up to three spells per day that are enlarged as though using the Enlarge Spell feat.</p>
<p>Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Enlarge Spell; Price 3,000 gp (lesser), 11,000 gp (normal), 24,500 gp (greater).</p>
<p>Metamagic, Extend: The wielder can cast up to three spells per day that are extended as though using the Extend Spell feat.</p>
<p>Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Extend Spell; Price 3,000 gp (lesser), 11,000 gp (normal), 24,500 gp (greater).</p>
<p>Metamagic, Maximize: The wielder can cast up to three spells per day that are maximized as though using the Maximize Spell feat.</p>
<p>Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Maximize Spell feat; Price 14,000 gp (lesser), 54,000 gp (normal), 121,500 gp (greater).</p>
<p>Metamagic, Quicken: The wielder can cast up to three spells per day that are quickened as though using the Quicken Spell feat.</p>
<p>Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Quicken Spell; Price 35,000 gp (lesser), 75,500 gp (normal), 170,000 gp (greater).</p>
<p>Metamagic, Silent: The wielder can cast up to three spells per day without verbal components as though using the Silent Spell feat.</p>
<p>Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Silent Spell; Price 3,000 gp (lesser), 11,000 gp (normal), 24,500 gp (greater).</p>
<p>Negation: This device negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic items. The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a greater dispel magic spell, except it only affects magic items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod wielder needs to have used a ready action. The dispel check uses the rod's caster level (15th). The target item gets no saving throw, although the rod can't negate artifacts (even minor artifacts). The rod can function three times per day.</p>
<p>Strong varied; CL 15th; Craft Rod, dispel magic, and limited wish or miracle; Price 37,000 gp.</p>
<p>Python: This rod is longer than normal rods. It is about 4 feet long and weighs 10 pounds. It strikes as a +1/+1 quarterstaff. If the user throws the rod to the ground (a standard action), it grows to become a giant constrictor snake by the end of the round. The python obeys all commands of the owner. (In animal form, it retains the +1 enhancement bonus on attacks and damage possessed by the rod form.) The serpent returns to rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder desires, or whenever it moves farther than 100 feet from the owner. If the snake form is slain, it returns to rod form and cannot be activated again for three days. A python rod only functions if the possessor is good.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, baleful polymorph, creator must be good; Price 13,000 gp.</p>
<p>Rulership: This rod looks like a royal scepter worth at least 5,000 gp in materials and workmanship alone. The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 120 feet when she activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 300 Hit Dice can be ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher are entitled to a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. Ruled creatures obey the wielder as if she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken. The rod can be used for 500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous.</p>
<p>Strong enchantment; CL 20th; Craft Rod, mass charm monster; Price 60,000 gp; Cost 27,500 gp + 2,200 XP.</p>
<p>Security: This item creates a nondimensional space, a pocket paradise. There the rod's possessor and as many as 199 other creatures can stay in complete safety for a period of time, up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures affected. All fractions are rounded down.</p>
<p>In this pocket paradise, creatures don't age, and natural healing take place at twice the normal rate. Fresh water and food (fruits and vegetables only) are in abundance. The climate is comfortable for all creatures involved.</p>
<p>Activating the rod (a standard action) causes the wielder and all creatures touching the rod to be transported instantaneously to the paradise. Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise maintain physical contact, allowing all connected creatures in a circle or a chain to be affected by the rod. Unwilling creatures get a DC 17 Will save to negate the effect. If such a creature succeeds on its save, other creatures beyond that point in a chain can still be affected by the rod.</p>
<p>When the rod's effect expires or is dispelled, all the affected creatures instantly reappear in the location they occupied when the rod was activated. If something else occupies the space that a traveler would be returning to, then his body is displaced a sufficient distance to provide the space required for reentry. The rod's possessor can dismiss the effect whenever he wishes before the maximum time period expires, but the rod can only be activated once per week.</p>
<p>Strong conjuuration; CL 20th; Craft Rod, gate; Price 61,000 gp.</p>
<p>Splendor: The possessor of this rod gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Charisma score for as long as she holds or carries the item. Once per day, the rod creates and garbs her in clothing of the finest fabrics, plus adornments of furs and jewels. </p>
<p>Apparel created by the magic of the rod remains in existence for 12 hours. However, if the possessor attempts to sell or give away any part of it, to use it for a spell component, or the like, all the apparel immediately disappears. The same applies if any of it is forcibly taken from her.</p>
<p>The value of noble garb created by the rod ranges from 7,000 to 10,000 gp (1d4+6 x?1,000 gp)--1,000 gp for the fabric alone, 5,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for the jewel trim (maximum of twenty gems, maximum value 200 gp each).</p>
<p>In addition, the rod has a second special power, usable once per week. Upon command, it creates a palatial tent--a huge pavilion of silk 60 feet across. Inside the tent are temporary furnishings and food suitable to the splendor of the pavilion and sufficient to entertain as many as one hundred persons. The tent and its trappings last for one day. At the end of that time, the tent and all objects associated with it (including any items that were taken out of the tent) disappear.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Rod, eagle's splendor, fabricate, major creation; Price 25,000 gp.</p>
<p>Thunder and Lightning: Constructed of iron set with silver rivets, this rod has the properties of a +2 light mace. Its other magical powers are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thunder: Once per day, the rod can strike as a +3 light mace, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod's impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lightning: Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a +2 light mace (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod might not score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack hit, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still applies. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thunderclap: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a shout spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lightning Stroke: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt (9d6 points of electricity damage, Reflex DC 16 half ) to a range of 200 feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thunder and Lightning: Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap described above with a lightning bolt, as in the lightning stroke. The thunderclap affects all within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning stroke deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 9th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, lightning bolt, shout; Price 33,000 gp.</p>
<p>Viper: This rod strikes as a +2 heavy mace. Once per day, upon command, the head of the rod becomes that of an actual serpent for 10 minutes. During this period, any successful strike with the rod deals its usual damage and also poisons the creature hit. The poison deals 1d10 points of Constitution damage immediately (Fortitude DC 14 negates) and another 1d10 points of Constitution damage 1 minute later (Fortitude DC 14 negates). The rod only functions if its possessor is evil.</p>
<p>Moderate necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, poison, creator must be evil; Price 19,000 gp.</p>
<p>Withering: A rod of withering acts as a +1 light mace that deals no hit point damage. Instead, the wielder deals 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage to any creature she touches with the rod (by making a melee touch attack). If she scores a critical hit, the damage from that hit is permanent ability drain. In either case, the defender negates the effect with a DC 17 Fortitude save.</p>
<p>Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, contagion; Price 25,000 gp.</p>
<p>Wonder: A rod of wonder is a strange and unpredictable device that randomly generates any number of weird effects each time it is used. (Activating the rod is a standard action.) Typical powers of the rod include the following.</p>
<p>| d% | | Wondrous Effect | |  |
| 01-05 | | Slow creature pointed at for 10 rounds (Will DC 15 negates). | |  |
| 06-10 | | Faerie fire surrounds the target. | |  |

| 21-25 | | Wielder learns target's surface thoughts (as with detect thoughts) for 1d4 rounds (no save). | |  |

| 37-46 | | Lightning bolt (70 ft. long, 5 ft. wide), 6d6 damage (Reflex DC 15 half). | |  |
| 47-49 | | Stream of 600 large butterflies pours forth and flutters around for 2 rounds, blinding everyone (including wielder) within 25 ft. (Reflex DC 14 negates). | |  |
| 50-53 | | Enlarge person if within 60 ft. of rod (Fortitude DC 13 negates). | |  |
| 54-58 | | Darkness, 30-ft.-diameter hemisphere, centered 30 ft. away from rod. | |  |
| 59-62 | | Grass grows in 160-sq.-ft. area before the rod, or grass existing there grows to ten times normal size. | |  |
| 63-65 | | Turn ethereal any nonliving object of up to 1,000 lb. mass and up to 30 cu. ft. in size. | |  |
| 66-69 | | Reduce wielder to 1/12 height (no save). | |  |
| 70-79 | | Fireball at target or 100 ft. straight ahead, 6d6 damage (Reflex DC 15 half). | |  |
| 80-84 | | Invisibility covers rod wielder. | |  |
| 85-87 | | Leaves grow from target if within 60 ft. of rod. These last 24 hours. | |  |
| 88-90 | | 10-40 gems, value 1 gp each, shoot forth in a 30-ft.-long stream. Each gem deals 1 point of damage to any creature in its path: Roll 5d4 for the number of hits and divide them among the available targets. | |  |
| 91-95 | | Shimmering colors dance and play over a 40-ft.-by-30-ft. area in front of rod. Creatures therein are blinded for 1d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 15 negates). | |  |
| 96-97 | | Wielder (50% chance) or target (50% chance) turns permanently blue, green, or purple (no save). | |  |
| 98-100 | | Flesh to stone (or stone to flesh if target is stone already) if target is within 60 ft. (Fortitude DC 18 negates). | |  |
Moderate enchantment; CL 10th; Craft Rod, confusion, creator must be chaotic; Price 12,000 gp.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>RINGS</p>
<p>Rings bestow magical powers upon their wearers. Only a rare few have charges. Anyone can use a ring.</p>
<p>A character can only effectively wear two magic rings. A third magic ring doesn't work if the wearer is already wearing two magic rings.</p>
<p>Physical Description: Rings have no appreciable weight. Although exceptions exist that are crafted from glass or bone, the vast majority of rings are forged from metal--usually precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. A ring has AC 13, 2 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 25.</p>
<p>Activation: Usually, a ring's ability is activated by a command word (a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) or it works continually. Some rings have exceptional activation methods, according to their descriptions.</p>
<p>Special Qualities: Roll d%. A result of 01 indicates the ring is intelligent, 02-31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32-100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes. Rings with charges can never be intelligent.</p>

<p>Ring Descriptions</p>
<p>Standard rings are described below.</p>
<p>Animal Friendship: On command, this ring affects an animal as if the wearer had cast charm animal.</p>
<p>Faint enchantment; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, charm animal; Price 10,800 gp.</p>
<p>Blinking: On command, this ring makes the wearer blink, as with the blink spell.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, blink; Price 27,000 gp.</p>
<p>Chameleon Power: As a free action, the wearer of this ring can gain the ability to magically blend in with the surroundings. This provides a +10 competence bonus on her Hide checks. As a standard action, she can also command the ring to utilize the spell disguise self as often as she wants.</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, disguise self, invisibility; Price 12,700 gp.</p>
<p>Climbing: This ring is actually a magic leather cord that ties around a finger. It continually grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Climb checks.</p>
<p>Faint transmutatation; CL 5th; Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in the Climb skill; Price 2,500 gp.</p>
<p>Climbing, Improved: As climbing, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer's Climb checks.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks in the Climb skill; Price 10,000 gp.</p>
<p>Counterspells: This ring might seem to be a ring of spell storing upon first examination. However, while it allows a single spell of 1st through 6th level to be cast into it, that spell cannot be cast out of the ring again. Instead, should that spell ever be cast upon the wearer, the spell is immediately countered, as a counterspell action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer's part. Once so used, the spell cast within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as before) may be placed in it again.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Forge Ring, imbue with spell ability; Price 4,000 gp.</p>
<p>Djinni Calling: One of the many rings of fable, this &quot;genie&quot; ring is most useful indeed. It serves as a special gate by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the Elemental Plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Forge Ring, gate; Price 125,000 gp.</p>
<p>Elemental Command: All four kinds of elemental command rings are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties.</p>
<p>Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of him. If the wearer desires, he may forego this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.</p>
<p>Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned who attack the wearer take a -1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws from the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. He gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapon he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.</p>
<p>The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which his ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that he wears the ring. They show a healthy respect for the wearer if alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if he is strong. If he is weak, they hate and desire to slay him.</p>
<p>The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows:</p>
<p>| Element | Saving Throw Penalty | |  |
| Air | -2 against earth-based effects | |  |
| Earth | -2 against air- or electricity-based effects | |  |
| Fire | -2 against water- or cold-based effects | |  |
| Water | -2 against fire-based effects | |  |
In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind.</p>
<p>Ring of Elemental Command (Air)</p>

<li>
<p>Feather fall (unlimited use, wearer only)</p>

<p>Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Forge Ring, summon monster VI, all appropriate spells; Price 200,000 gp.</p>
<p>Energy Resistance: This reddish iron ring continually protects the wearer from damage from one type of energy--acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic (chosen by the creator of the item; determine randomly if found as part of a treasure hoard). Each time the wearer would normally take such damage, subtract the ring's resistance value from the damage dealt.</p>
<p>A minor ring of energy resistance grants 10 points of resistance. A major ring of energy resistance grants 20 points of resistance. A greater ring of energy resistance grants 30 points of resistance.</p>
<p>Faint (minor or major) or moderate (greater) abjuration; CL 3rd  (minor), 7th (major), or 11th (greater); Forge Ring, resist energy; Price 12,000 gp (minor), 28,000 gp (major), 44,000 gp (greater).</p>
<p>Evasion: This ring continually grants the wearer the ability to avoid damage as if she had evasion. Whenever she makes a Reflex saving throw to determine whether she takes half damage, a successful save results in no damage.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, jump; Price 25,000 gp.</p>
<p>Feather Falling: This ring is crafted with a feather pattern all around its edge. It acts exactly like a feather fall spell, activated immediately if the wearer falls more than 5 feet.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 1st; Forge Ring, feather fall; Price 2,200 gp.</p>
<p>Force Shield: An iron band, this simple ring generates a shield-sized (and shield-shaped) wall of force that stays with the ring and can be wielded by the wearer as if it were a heavy shield (+2 AC). This special creation has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance since it is weightless and encumbrance-free. It can be activated and deactivated at will as a free action.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, wall of force; Price 8,500 gp.</p>
<p>Freedom of Movement: This gold ring allows the wearer to act as if continually under the effect of a freedom of movement spell.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Forge Ring, freedom of movement; Price 40,000 gp.</p>
<p>Friend Shield: These curious rings always come in pairs. A friend shield ring without its mate is useless. Either wearer of one of a pair of the rings can, at any time, command his or her ring to cast a shield other spell with the wearer of the mated ring as the recipient. This effect has no range limitation. </p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; Forge Ring, shield other; Price 50,000 gp (for a pair).</p>
<p>Invisibility: By activating this simple silver ring, the wearer can benefit from invisibility, as the spell.</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, invisibility; Price 20,000 gp.</p>
<p>Jumping: This ring continually allows the wearer to leap about, providing a +5 competence bonus on all his Jump checks.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 2nd; Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in the Jump skill; Price 2,500 gp.</p>
<p>Jumping, Improved: As jumping, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer's Jump check.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks in the Jump skill; Price 10,000 gp.</p>
<p>Mind Shielding: This ring is usually of fine workmanship and wrought from heavy gold. The wearer is continually immune to detect thoughts, discern lies, and any attempt to magically discern her alignment.</p>
<p>Faint aburation; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, nondetection; Price 8,000 gp.</p>
<p>Protection: This ring offers continual magical protection in the form of a deflection bonus of +1 to +5 to AC.</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Forge Ring, shield of faith, caster must be of a level at least three times greater than the bonus of the ring; Price 2,000 gp (ring +1); 8,000 gp (ring +2); 18,000 gp (ring +3); 32,000 gp (ring +4); 50,000 gp (ring +5).</p>
<p>Ram: The ring of the ram is an ornate ring forged of hard metal, usually iron or an iron alloy. It has the head of a ram as its device.</p>
<p>The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ramlike force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance. </p>
<p>The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. (The ram has Strength 25 and is Large.) The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended.</p>
<p>In addition to its attack mode, the ring of the ram also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with Strength 25. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength 29.</p>
<p>A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, bull's strength, telekinesis; Price 8,600 gp.</p>
<p>Regeneration: This white gold ring continually allows a living wearer to heal 1 point of damage per level every hour rather than every day. (This ability cannot be aided by the Heal skill.) Nonlethal damage heals at a rate of 1 point of damage per level every 5 minutes. If the wearer loses a limb, an organ, or any other body part while wearing this ring, the ring regenerates it as the spell. In either case, only damage taken while wearing the ring is regenerated.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Forge Ring, regenerate; Price 90,000 gp.</p>
<p>Shooting Stars: This ring has two modes of operation, one for being in shadowy darkness or outdoors at night and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night.</p>
<p>During the night under the open sky or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dancing lights (once per hour)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light (twice per night)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ball lightning (special, once per night)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shooting stars (special, three per week)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the ring wearer controls them in the same fashion (see the dancing lights spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created.</p>
<p>| Number of Balls | Damage per Ball | |  |
| 4 lightning balls | 1d6 points of damage each | |  |
| 3 lightning balls | 2d6 points of damage each | |  |
| 2 lightning balls | 3d6 points of damage each | |  |
| 1 lightning ball | 4d6 points of damage | |  |
Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. (Multiple balls can be released in the same round.)</p>
<p>The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. They impact for 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball) in a 5-foot-radius sphere for 24 points of fire damage.</p>
<p>Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it makes a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. Range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes, unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a save or be hit by the projectile.</p>
<p>Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Faerie fire (twice per day)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spark shower (special, once per day)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying a metal weapon. Those wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon take 4d8 points of damage.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 12th; Forge Ring, light, faerie fire, fireball, lightning bolt; Price 50,000 gp.</p>
<p>Spell Storing, Minor: A minor ring of spell storing contains up to three levels of spells that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. The user need not provide any material components or focus, or pay an XP cost to cast the spell, and there is no arcane spell failure chance for wearing armor (because the ring wearer need not gesture). The activation time for the ring is same as the casting time for the relevant spell, with a minimum of 1 standard action.</p>
<p>For a randomly generated ring, treat it as a scroll to determine what spells are stored in it. If you roll a spell that would put the ring over the three-level limit, ignore that roll; the ring has no more spells in it. (Not every newly discovered ring need be fully charged.)</p>
<p>A spellcaster can cast any spells into the ring, so long as the total spell levels do not add up to more than three. Metamagic versions of spells take up storage space equal to their spell level modified by the metamagic feat. A spellcaster can use a scroll to put a spell into the minor ring of spell storing.</p>
<p>The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells currently stored within it.</p>
<p>Faint evocation; CL 5th; Forge Ring, imbue with spell ability; Price 18,000 gp.</p>
<p>Spell Storing: As the minor ring of spell storing, except it holds up to five levels of spells.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, imbue with spell ability; Price 50,000 gp.</p>
<p>Spell Storing, Major: As the minor ring of spell storing, except it holds up to ten levels of spells.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 17th; Forge Ring, imbue with spell ability; Price 200,000 gp.</p>
<p>Spell Turning: Up to three times per day on command, this simple platinum band automatically reflects the next nine levels of spells cast at the wearer, exactly as if spell turning had been cast upon the wearer.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 13th; Forge Ring, spell turning; Price 98,280 gp.</p>
<p>Sustenance: This ring continually provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment. The ring also refreshes the body and mind, so that its wearer needs only sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. The ring must be worn for a full week before it begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another week to reattune it to himself.</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Forge Ring, create food and water; Price 2,500 gp.</p>
<p>Swimming: This silver ring has a wave pattern etched into the band. It continually grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Swim checks.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 2nd; Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in the Swim skill; Price 2,500 gp.</p>
<p>Swimming, Improved: As swimming, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer's Swim checks.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks in the Swim skill; Price 10,000 gp.</p>
<p>Telekinesis: This ring allows the caster to use the spell telekinesis on command.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, telekinesis; Price 75,000 gp.</p>
<p>Three Wishes: This ring is set with three rubies. Each ruby stores a wish spell, activated by the ring. When a wish is used, that ruby disappears. For a randomly generated ring, roll 1d3 to determine the remaining number of rubies. When all the wishes are used, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.</p>
<p>Strong evocation (if miracle is used); CL 20th; Forge Ring, wish or miracle; Price 97,950 gp; Cost 11,475 gp + 15,918 XP.</p>
<p>Water Walking: This ring, set with an opal, allows the wearer to continually utilize the effects of the spell water walk.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, water walk; Price 15,000 gp.</p>
<p>Wizardry: This special ring comes in four kinds (ring of wizardry I, ring of wizardry II, ring of wizardry III, and ring of wizardry IV), all of them useful only to arcane spellcasters. The wearer's arcane spells per day are doubled for one specific spell level. A ring of wizardry I doubles 1st-level spells, a ring of wizardry II doubles 2nd-level spells, a ring of wizardry III doubles 3rd-level spells, and a ring of wizardry IV doubles 4th-level spells. Bonus spells from high ability scores or school specialization are not doubled.</p>
<p>Moderate (wizardry I) or strong (wizardry II-IV) (no school); CL 11th (I), 14th (II), 17th (III), 20th (IV); Forge Ring, limited wish; Price 20,000 gp (I), 40,000 gp (II), 70,000 gp (III), 100,000 gp (IV).</p>
<p>X-Ray Vision: On command, this ring gives its possessor the ability to see into and through solid matter. Vision range is 20 feet, with the viewer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if there is no illumination. X-ray vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead blocks the vision.</p>
<p>Using the ring is physically exhausting, causing the wearer 1 point of Constitution damage per minute after the first 10 minutes of use in a single day.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 6th; Forge Ring, true seeing; Price 25,000 gp.</p>

<p>MAGIC ITEMS V (WONDROUS ITEMS)</p>
<p>WONDROUS ITEMS</p>
<p>This is a catch-all category for anything that doesn't fall into the other groups. Anyone can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description).</p>
<p>Physical Description: Varies.</p>
<p>Activation: Usually use activated or command word, but details vary from item to item.</p>
<p>Special Qualities: Roll d%. An 01 result indicates the wondrous item is intelligent, 02-31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32-100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes.</p>
<p>Wondrous items with charges can never be intelligent.</p>

<p>Wondrous Item Descriptions</p>
<p>Standard wondrous items are described below.</p>
<p>Amulet of Health: This amulet is a golden disk on a chain. It usually bears the image of a lion or other powerful animal. The amulet grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to Constitution of +2, +4, or +6.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, bear's endurance; Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).</p>
<p>Amulet of Mighty Fists: This amulet grants an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on attack and damage rolls with unarmed attacks and natural weapons.</p>
<p>Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, greater magic fang, creator's caster level must be at least three times the amulet's bonus; Price 6,000 gp (+1), 24,000 gp (+2), 54,000 gp (+3), 96,000 gp (+4), 150,000 gp (+5).</p>
<p>Amulet of Natural Armor: This amulet, usually crafted from bone or beast scales, toughens the wearer's body and flesh, giving him an enhancement bonus to his natural armor bonus of from +1 to +5, depending on the kind of amulet.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, barkskin, creator's caster level must be at least three times the amulet's bonus; Price 2,000 gp (+1), 8,000 gp (+2), 18,000 gp (+3), 32,000 gp (+4), or 50,000 gp (+5).</p>
<p>Amulet of the Planes: This device usually appears to be a black circular amulet, although any character looking closely at it sees a dark, moving swirl of color. The amulet allows its wearer to utilize plane shift. However, this is a difficult item to master. The user must make a DC 15 Intelligence check in order to get the amulet to take her to the plane (and the specific location on that plane) that she wants. If she fails, the amulet transports her and all those traveling with her to a random location on that plane (01-60 on d%) or to a random plane (61-100).</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift; Price 120,000 gp.</p>
<p>Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location: This silver amulet protects the wearer from scrying and magical location just as a nondetection spell does. If a divination spell is attempted against the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the caster had cast nondetection on herself ).</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, nondetection; Price 35,000 gp.</p>
<p>Apparatus of the Crab: This item appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel, but it has a secret catch (Search DC 20 to locate) that opens a hatch in one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds ten (unlabeled) levers: The device has the following characteristics: hp 200; hardness 15; Spd 20 ft., swim 20 ft.; AC 20 (-1 size, +11 natural); Atk +12 melee (2d8, 2 pincers).</p>
<p>| Lever (1d10) | | Lever Function | |  |
| 1 | | Extend/retract legs and tail | |  |
| 2 | | Uncover/cover forward porthole | |  |
| 3 | | Uncover/cover side portholes | |  |
| 4 | | Extend/retract pincers and feelers | |  |
| 5 | | Snap pincers | |  |
| 6 | | Move forward/backward | |  |
| 7 | | Turn left/right | |  |
| 8 | | Open &quot;eyes&quot; with continual flame inside/close &quot;eyes&quot; | |  |
| 9 | | Rise/sink in water | |  |
| 10 | | Open/close hatch | |  |</p>
<p>Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However, since two Medium characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round. The device can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a giant lobster.</p>
<p>Strong evocation and transmutation; CL 19th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, continual flame, creator must have 8 ranks in the Knowledge (architecture and engineering) skill; Price 90,000 gp;Weight 500 lb.</p>
<p>Bag of Holding: This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: Its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag's contents, depend on the bag's type, as shown on the table below.</p>
<p>| Bag | | Bag Weight | Contents Weight Limit | Contents Volume Limit | | Market Price | |  |
| Type I | | 15 lb. | 250 lb. | 30 cu. ft. | | 2,500 gp | |  |
| Type II | | 25 lb. | 500 lb. | 70 cu. ft. | | 5,000 gp | |  |
| Type III | | 35 lb. | 1,000 lb. | 150 cu. ft. | | 7,400 gp | |  |
| Type IV | | 60 lb. | 1,500 lb. | 250 cu. ft. | | 10,000 gp | |  |
If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action--unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.</p>
<p>If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest.</p>
<p>Bag of Tricks: This small sack appears normal and empty. However, anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill. Each of the three kinds of a bag of tricks produces a different set of animals. Use the following tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.</p>
<p>The heavy warhorse appears with harness and tack and accepts the character who drew it from the bag as a rider.</p>
<p>Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. Up to ten animals can be drawn from the bag each week.</p>
<p>Faint or moderate conjuration; CL 3rd (gray), 5th (rust), 9th (tan); Craft Wondrous Item, summon nature's ally II (gray), summon nature's ally III (rust), or summon nature's ally V (tan); Price 900 gp (gray); 3,000 gp (rust); 6,300 gp (tan).</p>
<p>| ---- Gray ---- | ------- Rust ------ | ------- Tan ------- | |  |
| d% | | Animal | | d% | | Animal | | d% | | Animal | |  |
| 01-30 | | Bat | | 01-30 | | Wolverine | | 01-30 | | Brown bear | |  |
| 31-60 | | Rat | | 31-60 | | Wolf | | 31-60 | | Lion | |  |
| 61-75 | | Cat | | 61-85 | | Boar | | 61-80 | | Heavy warhorse | |  |
| 76-90 | | Weasel | | 86-100 | | Black bear | | 81-90 | | Tiger | |  |
| 91-100 | | Badger | |  | |  | | 91-100 | | Rhinoceros | |  |
Bead of Force: This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. You can throw it up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.</p>
<p>It functions like a resilient sphere spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, disintegrate, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.</p>
<p>The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, resilient sphere; Price 3,000 gp.</p>
<p>Belt, Monk's: This simple rope belt, when wrapped around a character's waist, confers great ability in unarmed combat. The wearer's AC and unarmed damage is treated as a monk of five levels higher. If donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat, the belt lets her make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk. This AC bonus functions just like the monk's AC bonus.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, righteous might or transformation; Price 13,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Belt of Dwarvenkind: This belt gives the wearer a +4 competence bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks as they relate to dealing with dwarves, a +2 competence bonus on similar checks when dealing with gnomes and halflings, and a -2 competence penalty on similar checks when dealing with anyone else. The wearer can understand, speak, and read Dwarven. If the wearer is not a dwarf, he gains 60-foot darkvision, dwarven stonecunning, a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against poison, spells, or spell-like effects.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, tongues, creator must be a dwarf; Price 14,900 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Belt of Giant Strength: This wide belt is made of thick leather and studded with iron. The belt adds to the wearer's Strength score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +4 or +6.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, bull's strength; Price 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6);Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Blessed Book: This well-made tome is always of small size, typically no more than 12 inches tall, 8 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. All such books are durable, waterproof, bound with iron overlaid with silver, and locked.</p>
<p>A wizard can fill the 1,000 pages of a blessed book with spells without paying the 100 gp per page material cost. This book is never found as randomly generated treasure with spells already inscribed in it.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, secret page; Price 12,500 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Boat, Folding: A folding boat looks like a small wooden box--about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It can be used to store items like any other box. If a command word is given, however, the box unfolds itself to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold to a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship.</p>
<p>In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold four people comfortably, while the ship carries fifteen with ease.</p>
<p>A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate, creator must have 2 ranks in the Craft (shipmaking) skill; Price 7,200 gp;Weight 4 lb.</p>
<p>Boots of Elvenkind: These soft boots enable the wearer to move quietly in virtually any surroundings, granting a +5 competence bonus on Move Silently checks.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be an elf; Price 2,500 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Boots of Levitation: On command, these leather boots allow the wearer to levitate as if she had cast levitate on herself.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, levitate; Price 7,500 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Boots of Speed: As a free action, the wearer can click her boot heels together, enabling her to act as though affected by a haste spell for up to 10 rounds each day. The duration of the haste effect need not be consecutive rounds.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, haste; Price 12,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Boots of Striding and Springing: These boots increase the wearer's base land speed by 10 feet. In addition to this striding ability (considered an enhancement bonus), these boots allow the wearer to make great leaps. She can jump with a +5 competence bonus on Jump checks.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, longstrider, creator must have 5 ranks in the Jump skill; Price 5,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Boots of Teleportation: Any character wearing this footwear may teleport three times per day, exactly as if he had cast the spell of the same name.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, teleport; Price 49,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Boots of the Winterlands: This footgear bestows many powers upon the wearer. First, he is able to travel across snow at his normal speed, leaving no tracks. The boots also enable him to travel at normal speed across the most slippery ice (horizontal surfaces only, not vertical or sharply slanted ones) without falling or slipping. Finally, boots of the winterlands warm the wearer, as if he were affected by an endure elements spell.</p>
<p>Faint abjuration and transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, cat's grace, endure elements, pass without trace; Price 2,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Boots, Winged: These boots appear to be ordinary footgear. On command, the boots sprout wings at the heel and let the wearer fly, without having to maintain concentration, as if affected by a fly spell. He can fly three times day for up to 5 minutes per flight.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, fly; Price 16,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Bottle of Air: This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork. When taken to any airless environment it retains air within it at all times, continually renewing its contents. This means that a character can draw air out of the bottle to breathe. The bottle can even be shared by multiple characters who pass it around. Breathing out of the bottle is a standard action, but a character so doing can then act for as long as she can hold her breath.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, water breathing; Price 7,250 gp;Weight 2 lb.</p>
<p>Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals: This large container is usually fashioned from blue or green semiprecious stone. It is about 1 foot in diameter, half that deep, and relatively fragile. When the bowl is filled with fresh water, and certain words are spoken, a Large water elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the bowl functions as the summon monster VI spell. Only one elemental can be called at a time. A new elemental requires the bowl to be filled with new water, which cannot happen until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).</p>
<p>If salt water is used, the elemental is Huge rather than Large (as if summon monster VII had been cast).</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI, summon monster VII; Price 100,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Bracelet of Friends: This silver charm bracelet has four charms upon it when created. The owner may designate one person known to him to be keyed to one charm. (This designation takes a standard action, but once done it lasts forever or until changed.) When a charm is grasped and the name of the keyed individual is spoken, that person is called to the spot (a standard action) along with his or her gear, as long as the owner and the called person are on the same plane. The keyed individual knows who is calling, and the bracelet of friends only functions on willing travelers. Once a charm is activated, it disappears. Charms separated from the bracelet are worthless. A bracelet found with fewer than four charms is worth 25% less for each missing charm.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, refuge; Price 19,000 gp.</p>
<p>Bracers of Archery, Greater: These wristbands look like normal protective wear. The bracers empower the wearer to use any bow (not including crossbows) as if she were proficient in its use. If she already has proficiency with any type of bow, she gains a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls and a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls whenever using that type of bow. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Price 25,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Bracers of Archery, Lesser: These wristbands function as greater bracers of archery, except that they grant a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and no bonus on damage rolls.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Price 5,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Bracers of Armor: These items appear to be wrist or arm guards. They surround the wearer with an invisible but tangible field of force, granting him an armor bonus of +1 to +8, just as though he were wearing armor. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, mage armor, creator's caster level must be at least two times that of the bonus placed in the bracers; Price 1,000 gp (+1), 4,000 gp (+2), 9,000 gp (+3), 16,000 gp (+4), 25,000 gp (+5), 36,000 gp (+6), 49,000 gp (+7), 64,000 gp (+8);Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals: This device appears to be a normal container for holding burning coals. When a fire is lit in the brazier and the proper summoning words are spoken, a Large fire elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the brazier functions as the summon monster VI spell. If brimstone is added, the elemental is Huge instead of Large, and the brazier works as a summon monster VII spell. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new fire, which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI, summon monster VII; Price 100,000 gp; Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Brooch of Shielding: This appears to be a piece of silver or gold jewelry used to fasten a cloak or cape. In addition to this mundane task, it can absorb magic missiles of the sort generated by spell or spell-like ability. A brooch can absorb up to 101 points of damage from magic missiles before it melts and becomes useless.</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, shield; Price 1,500 gp.</p>
<p>Broom of Flying: This broom is able to fly through the air as if affected by an overland flight spell (average maneuverability) for up to 9 hours per day (split up as its owner desires). The broom can carry 200 pounds and fly at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed at 30 feet. In addition, the broom can travel alone to any destination named by the owner as long as she has a good idea of the location and layout of that destination. It comes to its owner from as far away as 300 yards when she speaks the command word. The broom of flying has a speed of 40 feet when it has no rider.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, overland flight, permanency; Price 17,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Candle of Invocation: Each of these special tapers is dedicated to one of the nine alignments. Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual so doing if the candle's alignment matches that of the character. Characters of the same alignment as the burning candle add a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks while within 30 feet of the flame.</p>
<p>A cleric whose alignment matches the candle's operates as if two levels higher for purposes of determining spells per day if he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him, as if he were of that higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours.</p>
<p>In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a gate spell, the respondent being of the same alignment as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in the process. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn't interfere with its magical properties.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, gate, creator must be same alignment as candle created; Price 8,400 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>Candle of Truth: This white tallow candle, when burned, calls into place a zone of truth spell (Will DC 13 negates) in a 5-foot radius centered on the candle. The zone lasts for 1 hour, as the candle burns. If the candle is snuffed before that time, the effect is canceled and the candle ruined.</p>
<p>Faint enchantment; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, zone of truth; Price 2,500 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>Cape of the Mountebank: On command, this bright red and gold cape allows the wearer to use the magic of the dimension door spell once per day. When he disappears, he leaves behind a cloud of smoke, appearing in a similar fashion at his destination.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, dimension door; Price 10,080 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Carpet of Flying: This rug is able to fly through the air as if affected by an overland flight spell of unlimited duration. The size, carrying capacity, and speed of the different carpets of flying are shown on the table below. Beautifully and intricately made, each carpet has its own command word to activate it--if the device is within voice range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions.</p>
<p>| Size | | Capacity | Speed | Weight | | Market Price | |  |
| 5 ft. by 5 ft. | | 200 lb. | 40 ft. | 8 lb. | | 20,000 gp | |  |
| 5 ft. by 10 ft. | | 400 lb. | 40 ft. | 15 lb. | | 35,000 gp | |  |
| 10 ft. by 10 ft. | | 800 lb. | 40 ft. | 10 lb. | | 60,000 gp | |  |
A carpet of flying can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. It has average maneuverability, but a carpet of flying can still hover.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, overland flight, permanency.</p>
<p>Censer of Controlling Air Elementals: This 6-inch-wide, 1-inch-high perforated golden vessel resembles a thurible found in a place of worship. If it is filled with incense and lit, summoning words spoken over it summon forth a Large air elemental. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the censer functions as the summon monster VI spell. If incense of meditation is burned within the censer, the air elemental is an elder air elemental instead (as if summon monster IX had just been cast). Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new piece of incense, which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI, summon monster IX; Price 100,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Chaos Diamond: This lustrous gemstone is uncut and about the size of a human fist. The gem grants its possessor the following powers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confusion, lesser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magic circle against law</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Word of chaos</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloak of chaos</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each power is usable 1d4 times per day. This is rolled for each power individually and the character does not </p>
<p>A nonchaotic character who possesses a chaos diamond gains one negative level. Although this level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the diamond is in the character's possession and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells).</p>
<p>Strong varied; CL 19th; Craft Wondrous Item, cloak of chaos, magic circle against law, random action, word of chaos, creator must be chaotic; Price 160,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Chime of Interruption: This instrument can be struck once every 10 minutes, and its resonant tone lasts for 3 full minutes.</p>
<p>While the chime is resonating, no spell requiring a verbal component can be cast within a 30-foot radius of it unless the caster can make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the spell's level).</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, shout; Price 16,800 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Chime of Opening: A chime of opening is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even an arcane lock cast by a wizard of lower than 15th level.</p>
<p>The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck, a clear tone rings forth, and in 1 round the target lock is unlocked, the shackle is loosed, the secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four uses of a chime of opening to get it open. A silence spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of ten times before it cracks and becomes useless.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, knock; Price 3,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Circlet of Blasting, Minor: On command, this simple golden headband projects a blast of searing light (3d8 points of damage) once per day.</p>
<p>Faint evocation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, searing light; Price 6,480 gp.</p>
<p>Circlet of Blasting, Major: On command, this elaborate golden headband projects a blast of searing light (5d8 maximized for 40 points of damage) once per day.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, Maximize Spell, searing light; Price 23,760 gp.</p>
<p>Circlet of Persuasion: This silver headband grants a +3 competence bonus on the wearer's Charisma-based checks.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, eagle's splendor; Price 4,500 gp.</p>
<p>Cloak of Arachnida: This black garment, embroidered with a weblike pattern in silk, gives the wearer the ability to climb as if a spider climb spell had been placed upon her. In addition, the cloak grants her immunity to entrapment by web spells or webs of any sort--she can actually move in webs at half her normal speed. Once per day, the wearer of this cloak can cast web. She also gains a +2 luck bonus on all Fortitude saves against poison from spiders.</p>
<p>Faint conjuration and transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, spider climb, web; Price 14,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Cloak of the Bat: Fashioned of dark brown or black cloth, this cloak bestows a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks. The wearer is also able to hang upside down from the ceiling, like a bat.</p>
<p>By holding the edges of the garment, the wearer is able to fly as per the spell. If he desires, the wearer can actually polymorph himself into an ordinary bat and fly accordingly. (All possessions worn or carried are part of the transformation.) Flying, either with the cloak or in bat form, can be accomplished only in darkness (either under the night sky or in a lightless or near-lightless environment underground). Either of the flying powers is usable for up to 7 minutes at a time, but after a flight of any duration the cloak cannot bestow any flying power for a like period of time.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, fly, polymorph; Price 26,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Cloak of Charisma: This lightweight and fashionable cloak has a highly decorative silver trim. When in a character's possession, it adds a +2, +4, or +6 enhancement bonus to her Charisma score.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, eagle's splendor; Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6); Weight 2 lb.</p>
<p>Cloak of Displacement, Minor: This item appears to be a normal cloak, but when worn by a character its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works similar to the displacement spell except that it only grants a 20% miss chance on attacks against the wearer. It functions continually.</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, displacement; Price 24,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Cloak of Displacement, Major: This item appears to be a normal cloak, but on command its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works just like the displacement spell and lasts for a total of 15 rounds per day, which the wearer can divide up as she sees fit.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, Extend Spell, displacement; Price 50,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Cloak of Elvenkind: This cloak of neutral gray cloth is indistinguishable from an ordinary cloak of the same color. However, when worn with the hood drawn up around the head, it gives the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks.</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, invisibility, creator must be an elf; Price 2,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Cloak of Etherealness: This silvery-gray cloak seems to absorb light rather than be illuminated by it. On command, the cloak makes its wearer ethereal (as the ethereal jaunt spell). The effect is dismissible. The cloak works for a total of up to 10 minutes per day. This duration need not be continuous.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, ethereal jaunt; Price 55,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Cloak of the Manta Ray: This cloak appears to be made of leather until the wearer enters salt water. At that time the cloak of the manta ray adheres to the individual, and he appears nearly identical to a manta ray (as the polymorph spell, except that it allows only manta ray form). He gains a +3 natural armor bonus, the ability to breathe underwater, and a swim speed of 60 feet, like a real manta ray.</p>
<p>Although the cloak does not enable the wearer to bite opponents as a manta ray does, it does have a tail spine that can be used to strike at opponents behind the wearer, dealing 1d6 points of damage. This attack can be used in addition to any other attack the character has, using his highest melee attack bonus. The wearer can release his arms from the cloak without sacrificing underwater movement if so desired.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, polymorph, water breathing; Price 7,200 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Cloak of Resistance: These garments offer magic protection in the form of a +1 to +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws (Fortitude, Reflex, and Will).</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, resistance, creator's caster level must be at least three times the cloak's bonus; Price 1,000 gp (+1), 4,000 gp (+2), 9,000 gp (+3), 16,000 gp (+4), 25,000 gp (+5);Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Crystal Ball: This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. A character can use the device to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell scrying (Will DC 16 negates).</p>
<p>Certain crystal balls have additional powers that can be used through the crystal ball on the target viewed.</p>
<p>| Crystal Ball Type | | Market Price | |  |
| Crystal ball | | 42,000 gp | |  |
| Crystal ball with see invisibility | | 50,000 gp | |  |
| Crystal ball with detect thoughts (Will DC 13 negates) | | 51,000 gp | |  |
| Crystal ball with telepathy* | | 70,000 gp | |  |
| Crystal ball with true seeing | | 80,000 gp | |  |
| * The viewer is able to send and receive silent mental messages with the person appearing in the crystal ball. Once per day the character may attempt to implant a suggestion (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) as well. | |  |
Moderate divination; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, scrying (plus any additional spells put into item); Weight 7 lb.</p>
<p>Cube of Force: This device is about 3/4 inch across and can be made of ivory, bone, or any hard mineral. It enables its possessor to put up a special wall of force 10 feet on a side around her person. This cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges, which are renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active, the possessor's speed is limited to the maximum value given on the table.</p>
<p>When the cube of force is active, attacks dealing more than 30 points of damage drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30 that they deal. Spells that affect the integrity of the screen also drain extra charges. These spells (given in the list below) cannot be cast into or out of the cube:</p>
<p>| Cube Face | Charge Cost per Minute | Maximum Speed | | Effect | |  |
| 1 | 1 | 30 ft. | | Keeps out gases, wind, etc. | |  |
| 2 | 2 | 20 ft. | | Keeps out nonliving matter | |  |
| 3 | 3 | 15 ft. | | Keeps out living matter | |  |
| 4 | 4 | 10 ft. | | Keeps out magic | |  |
| 5 | 6 | 10 ft. | | Keeps out all things | |  |
| 6 | 0 | As normal | | Deactivates | |  |</p>
<p>| Attack Form | | Extra Charges | |  |
| Horn of blasting | | 6 | |  |
| Wall of fire | | 2 | |  |
| Passwall | | 3 | |  |
| Disintegrate | | 6 | |  |
| Phase door | | 5 | |  |
| Prismatic spray | | 7 | |  |
Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, wall of force; Price 62,000 gp.</p>
<p>Cube of Frost Resistance: This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cube-shaped area 10 feet on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a surface). The temperature within this area is always at least 65°F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 round (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses into its portable form and cannot be reactivated for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage in a 10-round period, the cube is destroyed.</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, protection from energy; Price 27,000 gp.</p>
<p>Cubic Gate: This item is fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a plane, one of which is the Material Plane. The character creating the item should choose the planes to which the other five sides are keyed.</p>
<p>If a side of the cubic gate is pressed once, it opens a gate to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the gate. It is impossible to open more than one gate at a time.</p>
<p>If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. (The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves).</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift; Price 164,000 gp.</p>
<p>Darkskull: This skull, carved from ebony, is wholly evil. Wherever the skull goes, the area around it is treated as though an unhallow spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin (except that no additional spell effect is tied or fixed to the darkskull).</p>
<p>Moderate evocation [evil]; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, unhallow, creator must be evil; Price 60,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Decanter of Endless Water: If the stopper is removed from this ordinary-looking flask and a command word spoken, an amount of fresh or salt water pours out. Separate command words determine the type as well as the volume and velocity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Stream&quot; pours out 1 gallon per round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Fountain&quot; produces a 5-foot-long stream at 5 gallons per round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Geyser&quot; produces a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30 gallons per round.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The geyser effect causes considerable back pressure, requiring the holder to make a DC 12 Strength check to avoid being knocked down. The force of the geyser deals 1d4 points of damage but can only affect one target per round. The command word must be spoken to stop it.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, control water; Price 9,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.</p>
<p>Deck of Illusions: This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wooden box. A full deck consists of thirty-four cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a major image of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents of a full deck using either ordinary playing cards or tarot cards.)</p>

A randomly generated deck is usually complete (11-100 on d%), but may be discovered (01-10) with 1d20 of its cards missing. If cards are missing, reduce the price by a corresponding amount.</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, major image; Price 8,100 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>Dimensional Shackles: These shackles have golden runes traced across their cold iron surface. Any creature bound within them is affected as if a dimensional anchor spell were cast upon her (no save). They fit any Small to Large creature. The DC to break or slip out of the shackles is 30.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, dimensional anchor; Price 28,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Drums of Panic: These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a 20-foot-radius safe zone around the drums) are affected as by a fear spell (Will DC 16 partial). Drums of panic can be used once per day.</p>
<p>Moderate necromancy; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, fear; Price 30,000 gp;Weight 10 lb. for the pair.</p>
<p>Dust of Appearance: This fine powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of blur and displacement. (In this, it works just like the faerie fire spell). The dust also reveals figments, mirror images, and projected images for what they are. A creature coated with the dust takes a -30 penalty on its Hide checks. The dust's effect lasts for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Dust of appearance is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes.</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, glitterdust; Price 1,800 gp.</p>
<p>Dust of Disappearance: This dust looks just like dust of appearance and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as greater invisibility). Normal vision can't see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including see invisibility or invisibility purge. Dust of appearance, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by dust of disappearance. Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection.</p>
<p>The greater invisibility bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d6 rounds.The invisible creature doesn't know when the duration will end.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, greater invisibility; Price 3,500 gp.</p>
<p>Dust of Dryness: This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed to nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled down, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.</p>
<p>If the dust is employed against an elemental with the water subtype, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the creature even if its saving throw succeeds.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, control water; Price 850 gp.</p>
<p>Dust of Illusion: This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or powdered graphite. Stare at it, however, and the dust changes color and form. Put dust of illusion on a creature, and that creature is affected as if by a disguise self glamer, with the individual who sprinkles the dust envisioning the illusion desired. An unwilling target is allowed a DC 11 Reflex save to avoid the dust. The glamer lasts for 2 hours.</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self; Price 1,200 gp.</p>
<p>Dust of Tracelessness: This normal-seeming dust is actually a magic powder that can conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions. Tossing a handful of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 100 square feet of floor space to become as dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a decade.</p>
<p>A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as many as a dozen men and horses to be obliterated for 250 feet back into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, and no magical aura lingers afterward from this use of the dust. Survival checks made to track a quarry across an area affected by this dust have a DC 20 higher than normal.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, pass without trace; Price 250 gp.</p>
<p>Efficient Quiver: This appears to be a typical arrow container capable of holding about twenty arrows. It has three distinct portions, each with a nondimensional space allowing it to store far more than would normally be possible. The first and smallest one can contain up to sixty objects of the same general size and shape as an arrow. The second slightly longer compartment holds up to eighteen objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains as many as six objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (spears, staffs, or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can produce any item she wishes, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard. The efficient quiver weighs the same no matter what's placed inside it.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest; Price 1,800 gp;Weight 2 lb.</p>
<p>Efreeti Bottle: This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. A thin stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly. There is a 10% chance (01-10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91-100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three wishes. In either case, the efreeti afterward disappears forever. The other 80% of the time (11-90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti's death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day's effect.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 14th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VII; Price 145,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Elemental Gem: This gem contains a conjuration spell attuned to a specific Elemental Plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water).</p>
<p>When the gem is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a Large elemental appears as if summoned by a summon nature's ally spell. The elemental is under the control of the creature that broke the gem.</p>
<p>The coloration of the gem varies with the type of elemental it summons. Air elemental gems are transparent, earth elemental gems are light brown, fire elemental gems are reddish orange, and water elemental gems are blue-green.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon nature's ally V; Price 2,250 gp.</p>
<p>Elixir of Fire Breath: This strange elixir bestows upon the drinker the ability to spit gouts of flame. He can breathe fire up to three times, each time dealing 4d6 points of fire damage to a single target up to 25 feet away. The victim can attempt a DC 13 Reflex save for half damage. Unused blasts dissipate 1 hour after the liquid is consumed.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, scorching ray; Price 1,100 gp.</p>
<p>Elixir of Hiding: A character drinking this liquid gains an intuitive ability to hide (+10 competence bonus on Hide checks for 1 hour).</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, invisibility; Price 250 gp.</p>
<p>Elixir of Love: This sweet-tasting liquid causes the character drinking it to become charmed with the first creature she sees after consuming the draft (as charm person--the drinker must be a humanoid of Medium or smaller size, Will DC 14 negates). The charm effects wear off in 1d3 hours.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, charm person; Price 150 gp.</p>
<p>Elixir of Sneaking: This draught of liquid grants the drinker the ability to walk softly and dampens sound around her slightly, granting a +10 competence bonus on Move Silently checks for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, silence; Price 250 gp.</p>
<p>Elixir of Swimming: This elixir bestows swimming ability. An almost imperceptible magic sheath surrounds the drinker, allowing him to glide through the water easily (+10 competence bonus on Swim checks for 1 hour).</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must have 5 ranks in the Swim skill; Price 250 gp.</p>
<p>Elixir of Truth: This elixir forces the individual drinking it to say nothing but the truth for 10 minutes (Will DC 13 negates).</p>
<p>She is compelled to answer any questions put to her in that time, but with each question she is free to make a separate DC 13 Will save. If one of these secondary saves is successful, she doesn't break free of the truth-compelling enchantment but also doesn't have to answer that particular question. No more than one question can be asked each round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment.</p>
<p>Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, zone of truth; Price 500 gp.</p>
<p>Elixir of Vision: Drinking this elixir grants the imbiber the ability to notice acute details with great accuracy (+10 competence bonus on Search checks for 1 hour).</p>
<p>Faint divination; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Price 250 gp.</p>
<p>Eversmoking Bottle: This metal urn is identical in appearance to an efreeti bottle, except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains smoke-filled until the eversmoking bottle is stoppered.</p>
<p>The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke dissipates normally. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, pyrotechnics; Price 5,400 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Eyes of Charming: These two crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes. The wearer is able to use charm person (one target per round) merely by meeting a target's gaze. Those failing a DC 16 Will save are charmed as per the spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10.</p>
<p>Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, Heighten Spell, charm person; Price 56,000 gp for a pair.</p>
<p>Eyes of Doom: These crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes, enabling him to cast doom upon those around him (one target per round) as a gaze attack, except that the wearer must take a standard action, and those merely looking at the wearer are not affected. Those failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the doom spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10. However, if the wearer has both lenses, he gains the additional power of a continual deathwatch effect and can use fear (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack once per week.</p>
<p>Moderate necromancy; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, doom, deathwatch, fear; Price 25,000 gp.</p>
<p>Eyes of the Eagle: These items are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer. These lenses grant a +5 competence bonus on Spot checks. Wearing only one of the pair causes a character to become dizzy and, in effect, stunned for 1 round. Thereafter, the wearer can use the single lens without being stunned so long as she covers her other eye. Of course, she can remove the single lens and see normally at any time, or wear both lenses to end or avoid the dizziness.</p>
<p>Faint divination; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, clairaudience/clairvoyance; Price 2,500 gp.</p>
<p>Eyes of Petrification: These items are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer. They allow her to use a petrification gaze attack (Fortitude DC 19 negates) for 10 rounds per day. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, flesh to stone; Price 98,000 gp.</p>
<p>Figurines of Wondrous Power: Each of the several kinds of figurines of wondrous power appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.</p>
<p>If a figurine of wondrous power is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.</p>
<p>Bronze Griffon: When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 10,000 gp.</p>
<p>Ebony Fly: When animated, an ebony fly is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a hippogriff but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 10,000 gp.</p>
<p>Golden Lions: These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for one full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 16,500 gp.</p>
<p>Ivory Goats: These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Goat of Traveling: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of one day each week--continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for not less than one day before it can again be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount, with the statistics of a light warhorse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every two weeks for up to 3 hours per use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 21,000 gp.</p>
<p>Marble Elephant: This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a marble elephant grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine's owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 17,000 gp.</p>
<p>Obsidian Steed: This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy warhorse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: overland flight, plane shift, and ethereal jaunt. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit.</p>
<p>Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, etherealness, fly, plane shift; Price 28,500 gp.</p>
<p>Onyx Dog: When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. (It has the scent ability and adds +4 to its Spot and Search checks.) It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can see invisibility. An onyx dog can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 15,500 gp.</p>
<p>Serpentine Owl: This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl according to the command word used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears. (Remember the limitations of its Intelligence.)</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 9,100 gp.</p>
<p>Silver Raven: This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an animal messenger spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous.</p>
<p>Faint enchantment and transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, animal messenger, animate objects; Price 3,800 gp.</p>
<p>Feather Token: Each of these items is a small feather that has a power to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are described below. Each token is usable once.</p>
<p>Anchor: A token useful to moor a craft in water so as to render it immobile for up to one day.</p>
<p>Bird: A token that can be used to deliver a small written message unerringly to a designated target as would a carrier pigeon. The token lasts as long as it takes to carry the message.</p>
<p>Fan: A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed. The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land.</p>
<p>Swan Boat: A token that forms a swanlike boat capable of moving on water at a speed of 60 feet. It can carry eight horses and gear or thirty-two Medium characters or any equivalent combination. The boat lasts for one day.</p>
<p>Tree: A token that causes a great oak to spring into being (5-foot diameter trunk, 60-foot height, 40-foot top diameter). This is an instantaneous effect.</p>
<p>Whip: A token that forms into a huge leather whip and wields itself against any opponent desired just like a dancing weapon. The weapon has a +10 base attack bonus, does 1d6+1 points of damage, has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and a makes a free grapple attack (with a +15 attack bonus) if it hits. The whip lasts no longer than 1 hour.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, major creation; Price 50 gp (anchor), 300 gp (bird), 200 gp (fan), 450 gp (swan boat), 400 gp (tree), 500 gp (whip).</p>
<p>Gauntlets of Ogre Power: These gauntlets are made of tough leather with iron studs running across the back of the hands and fingers. They grant the wearer great strength, adding a +2 enhancement bonus to his Strength score. Both gauntlets must be worn for the magic to be effective.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, bull's strength; Price 4,000 gp;Weight 4 lb.</p>
<p>Gauntlet of Rust: This single metal gauntlet looks rusted and pitted but is actually quite powerful. Once per day, it can affect an object as with the rusting grasp spell. It also completely protects the wearer and her gear from rust (magical or otherwise), including the attack of a rust monster.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, rusting grasp; Price 11,500 gp;Weight 2 lb.</p>
<p>Gem of Brightness: This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of a command word, the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another command word causes the gem of brightness to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A newly created gem of brightness has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical.</p>
<p>Faint evocation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, daylight; Price 13,000 gp.</p>
<p>Gem of Seeing: This finely cut and polished stone is indistinguishable from an ordinary jewel in appearance. When it is gazed through, a gem of seeing enables the user to see as though she were affected by the true seeing spell. A gem of seeing can be used for as much as 30 minutes a day, divided up into periods of minutes or rounds as the user sees fit.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Price 75,000 gp.</p>
<p>Gloves of Arrow Snaring: Once snugly worn, these gloves seem to meld with the hands, becoming almost invisible. Twice per day, the wearer can act as if he had the Snatch Arrows feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites for it. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective. At least one hand must be free to take advantage of the magic.</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, shield; Price 4,000 gp.</p>
<p>Gloves of Dexterity: These thin leather gloves are very flexible and allow for delicate manipulation. They add to the wearer's Dexterity score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +2, +4, or +6. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, cat's grace; Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).</p>
<p>Glove of Storing: This device is a simple leather glove. On command, one item held in the hand wearing the glove disappears. The item can weigh no more than 20 pounds and must be able to be held in one hand. While stored, the item has negligible weight. With a snap of the fingers wearing the glove, the item reappears. A glove can only store one item at a time. Storing or retrieving the item is a free action. The item is held in stasis and shrunk down so small within the palm of the glove that it cannot be seen. Spell durations are not suppressed, but continue to expire. If an effect is suppressed or dispelled, the stored item appears instantly.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, shrink item; Price 10,000 gp (one glove).</p>
<p>Gloves of Swimming and Climbing: These apparently normal lightweight gloves grant a +5 competence bonus on Swim checks and Climb checks. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, bull's strength, cat's grace; Price 6,250 gp.</p>
<p>Goggles of Minute Seeing: The lenses of this item are made of special crystal. When placed over the eyes of the wearer, the lenses enable her to see much better than normal at distances of 1 foot or less, granting her a +5 competence bonus on Search checks to find secret doors, traps, and similar concealed objects. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.</p>
<p>Faint divination; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Price 1,250 gp.</p>
<p>Goggles of Night: The lenses of this item are made of dark crystal. Even though the lenses are opaque, when placed over the eyes of the wearer they enable him to see normally and also grant him 60-foot darkvision. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, darkvision; Price 12,000 gp.</p>
<p>Golem Manual: A golem manual contains information, incantations and magical power that help a character to craft a golem. The instructions therein grant a +5 competence bonus on skill checks made to craft the golem's body. Each manual also holds the prerequisite spells needed for a specific golem, effectively grants the builder use of the Craft Construct feat during the construction of the golem, and grants the character an increase to her caster level for the purpose of crafting a golem. Any golem built using a golem manual does not cost the creator any XP, since the requisite XP are &quot;contained&quot; in the book and &quot;expended&quot; by the book during the creation process.</p>
<p>The spells included in a golem manual require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem's body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book's ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated.</p>
<p>Clay Golem Manual: The book contains animate objects, bless, commune, prayer, and resurrection. The reader may treat her caster level as two levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a clay golem. The book supplies 1,540 XP for the creation of a clay golem.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration, divination, enchantment, and transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 11th, animate objects, commune, prayer, resurrection; Price 12,000 gp; Cost 2,150 gp + 1,712 XP; Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Flesh Golem Manual: The book contains animate dead, bull's strength, geas/quest, and limited wish. The reader may treat her caster level as one level higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a flesh golem. The book supplies 780 XP for the creation of a flesh golem.</p>
<p>Moderate enchantment, necromancy [evil], and transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 8th, animate dead, bull's strength, geas/quest, limited wish; Price 8,000 gp; Cost 2,050 gp + 944 XP; Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Iron Golem Manual: The book contains cloudkill, geas/quest, limited wish, and polymorph any object. The reader may treat her caster level as four levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a iron golem. The book supplies 5,600 XP for the creation of a iron golem.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration, enchantment and transmutation; CL 16th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 16th, cloudkill, geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object; Price 35,000 gp; Cost 3,500 gp + 5,880 XP; Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Stone Golem Manual: The book contains geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object, and slow. The reader may treat her caster level as three levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a stone golem. The book supplies 3,400 XP for the creation of a stone golem.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration and enchantment; CL 14th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 14th, antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of stunning; Price 22,000 gp; Cost 2,500 gp + 3,600 XP; Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Stone Golem Manual, Greater: The book contains geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object, and slow. The reader may treat her caster level as three levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a stone golem. The book supplies 7,640 XP for the creation of a greater stone golem.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration and enchantment; CL 16th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 16th, antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of stunning; Price 44,000 gp; Cost 2,900 gp + 7,872 XP; Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Hand of Glory: This mummified human hand hangs by a leather cord around a character's neck (taking up space as a magic necklace would). If a magic ring is placed on one of the fingers of the hand, the wearer benefits from the ring as if wearing it herself, and it does not count against her two-ring limit. The hand can wear only one ring at a time. Even without a ring, the hand itself allows its wearer to use daylight and see invisibility each once per day.</p>
<p>Faint varied; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate dead, daylight, detect invisibility; Price 8,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.</p>
<p>Hand of the Mage: This mummified elf hand hangs by a golden chain around a character's neck (taking up space as a magic necklace would). It allows the wearer to utilize the spell mage hand at will.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, mage hand; Price 900 gp;Weight 2 lb.</p>
<p>Handy Haversack: A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.</p>
<p>While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power in addition. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest; Price 2,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Harp of Charming: This instrument is a golden, intricately carved harp. When played, it enables the performer to work one suggestion (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) into the music for each 10 minutes of playing if he can succeed on a DC 14 Perform (string instruments) check. If the check fails, the audience cannot be affected by any further performances from the harpist for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, suggestion; Price 7,500 gp;Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Hat of Disguise: This apparently normal hat allows its wearer to alter her appearance as with a disguise self spell. As part of the disguise, the hat can be changed to appear as a comb, ribbon, headband, cap, coif, hood, helmet, and so on.</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self; Price 1,800 gp.</p>
<p>Headband of Intellect: This device is a light cord with a small gem set so that it rests upon the forehead of the wearer. The headband adds to the wearer's Intelligence score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +2, +4, or +6. This enhancement bonus does not earn the wearer extra skill points when a new level is attained; use the unenhanced Intelligence bonus to determine skill points.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, fox's cunning; Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).</p>
<p>Helm of Brilliance: This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: ten diamonds, twenty rubies, thirty fire opals, and forty opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crownlike, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ruby: Wall of fire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fire opal: Fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opal: Daylight</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The helm provides resistance to fire 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.</p>
<p>If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.</p>
<p>Strong varied; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect undead, fireball, flame blade, light, prismatic spray, protection from energy, wall of fire; Price 125,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Helm of Comprehend Languages and Read Magic: Appearing as a normal helmet, a helm of comprehend languages and read magic grants its wearer the ability to understand the spoken words of any creature and to read text in any language and any magical writing. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Decipher Script checks to understand messages written in incomplete, archaic, or exotic forms. Note that understanding a magical text does not necessarily imply spell use.</p>
<p>Faint divination; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, comprehend languages, read magic; Price 5,200 gp; Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Helm of Telepathy: The wearer can use detect thoughts at will. Furthermore, he can send a telepathic message to anyone whose surface thoughts he is reading (allowing two-way communication). Once per day, the wearer of the helm can implant a suggestion (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) along with his telepathic message.</p>
<p>Faint divination and enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, suggestion; Price 27,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Helm of Teleportation: A character wearing this device may teleport three times per day, exactly as if he had cast the spell of the same name.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, teleport; Price 73,500 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Helm of Underwater Action: The wearer of this helmet can see underwater. Drawing the small lenses in compartments on either side into position before the wearer's eyes activates the visual properties of the helm, allowing her to see five times farther than water and light conditions would allow for normal human vision. (Weeds, obstructions, and the like block vision in the usual manner.) If the command word is spoken, the helm of underwater action creates a globe of air around the wearer's head and maintains it until the command word is spoken again, enabling her to breathe freely.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, water breathing; Price 57,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Horn of Blasting: This horn appears to be a normal trumpet. It can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the command word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it deals 5d6 points of sonic damage to creatures within a 40-foot cone and causes them to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (a DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the deafening). Crystalline objects and creatures take 7d6 points of sonic damage, with no save unless they're held, worn, or carried by creatures (Will DC 16 negates).</p>
<p>If a horn of blasting is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a 20% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals 10d6 points of damage to the person sounding it.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, shout; Price 20,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Horn of Blasting, Greater: This horn functions as a horn of blasting, except that it deals 10d6 points of sonic damage, stuns creatures for 1 round, and deafens them for 4d6 rounds (a DC 19 Fortitude reduces the damage by half and negates the stunning and deafening). Crystalline objects take 16d6 points of sonic damage as described for the horn of blasting. A greater horn of blasting also has a 20% cumulative chance of exploding.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 16th; Craft Wondrous Item, greater shout; Price 70,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Horn of Fog: This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an obscuring mist spell. The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower each round that the user continues to blow the horn; fog clouds travel 10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation point unless blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a deep, foghorn-like noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, obscuring mist; Price 2,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Horn of Goodness/Evil: This trumpet adapts itself to its owner, so it produces either a good or an evil effect depending on the owner's alignment. If the owner is neither good nor evil, the horn has no power whatsoever. If he is good, then blowing the horn has the effect of a magic circle against evil. If he is evil, then blowing the horn has the effect of a magic circle against good. In either case, this ward lasts for 1 hour. The horn can be blown once per day.</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, magic circle against good, magic circle against evil; Price 6,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Horn of the Tritons: This device is a conch shell that can be blown once per day except by a triton which can sound it three times per day. A horn of the tritons can perform any one of the following functions when blown.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Calm rough waters in a 1-mile radius. This effect dispels a summoned water elemental if it fails a DC 16 Will save.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attract 5d4 Large sharks (01-30 on d%), 5d6 Medium sharks (31-80), or 1d10 sea lions (81-100) if the character is in a body of water in which such creatures dwell. The creatures are friendly and obey, to the best of their ability, the one who sounded the horn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Causes aquatic creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 within 500 feet to become panicked as if they had been targeted by a fear spell (Will DC 16 partial). Those who successfully save are shaken for 3d6 rounds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any sounding of a horn of the tritons can be heard by all tritons within a 3-mile radius.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration and transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, fear, summon monster V, control water, creator must be a triton or get construction aid from a triton; Price 15,100 gp; Weight 2 lb.</p>
<p>Horn of Valhalla: This magic instrument comes in four varieties. Each appears to be normal until someone speaks its command word and blows the horn. Then the horn summons a number of human barbarians to fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can be blown just once every seven days. Roll d% and refer to the table below to see what type of horn is found. The horn's type determines what barbarians are summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a horn of Valhalla but doesn't have the prerequisite is attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned.</p>
<p>| d% | | Type of Horn | Barbarians Summoned | Prerequisite | |  |
| 01-40 | | Silver | 2d4+2, 2nd level | None | |  |
| 41-75 | | Brass | 2d4+1, 3rd level | Spellcaster level 1st | |  |
| 76-90 | | Bronze | 2d4, 4th level | Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic music ability | |  |
| 91-100 | | Iron | 1d4+1, 5th level | Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic music ability | |  |
Summoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people (though they seem to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for barbarians. They attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until they or their opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI; Price 50,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.</p>
<p>Horseshoes of Speed: These iron shoes come in sets of four like ordinary horseshoes. When affixed to an animal's hooves, they increase the animal's base land speed by 30 feet; this counts as an enhancement bonus. As with other effects that increase speed, jumping distances increase proportionally. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, haste; Price 3,000 gp;Weight 12 lb. (for four).</p>
<p>Horseshoes of a Zephyr: These four iron shoes are affixed like normal horseshoes. They allow a horse to travel without actually touching the ground. The horse must still run above (always around 4 inches above) a roughly horizontal surface. This means that nonsolid or unstable surfaces can be crossed, and that movement is possible without leaving tracks on any sort of ground. The horse moves at its normal base land speed. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, levitate; Price 6,000 gp;Weight 4 lb. (for four).</p>
<p>Incense of Meditation: This small rectangular block of sweet smelling incense is visually indistinguishable from nonmagical incense until lit. When it is burning, the special fragrance and pearly-hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 Spellcraft check.</p>
<p>When a divine spellcaster lights a block of incense of meditation and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense enables him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the Maximize Spell feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal level, not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat).</p>
<p>Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, Maximize Spell, bless; Price 4,900 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Instant Fortress: This metal cube is small, but when activated by speaking a command word it grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress--even knock spells can't open the door.</p>
<p>The adamantine walls of instant fortress have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a wish or a miracle, which restores 50 points of damage taken.</p>
<p>The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 half ).</p>
<p>The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, mage's magnificent mansion; Price 55,000 gp.</p>
<p>Ioun Stones: These crystalline stones always float in the air and must be within 3 feet of their owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires a stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, a stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.</p>
<p>| Color | | Shape | Effect | | Market Price | |  |
| Clear | Spindle | Sustains creature without food or water | | 4,000 gp | |  |
| Dusty rose | Prism | +1 insight bonus to AC | | 5,000 gp | |  |
| Deep red | Sphere | +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity | | 8,000 gp | |  |
| Incandescent blue | Sphere | +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom | | 8,000 gp | |  |
| Pale blue | Rhomboid | +2 enhancement bonus to Strength | | 8,000 gp | |  |

| Pink and green | Sphere | +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma | | 8,000 gp | |  |

| Iridescent | Spindle | Sustains creature without air | | 18,000 gp | |  |
| Pale lavender | Ellipsoid | Absorbs spells of 4th level or lower1 | | 20,000 gp | |  |
| Pearly white | Spindle | Regenerate 1 point of damage per hour | | 20,000 gp | |  |
| Pale green | Prism | +1 competence bonus on attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks | | 30,000 gp | |  |
| Orange | Prism | +1 caster level | | 30,000 gp | |  |
| Lavender and green | Ellipsoid | Absorbs spells of 8th level or lower2 | | 40,000 gp | |  |
| 1 After absorbing twenty spell levels, the stone burns out and turns to dull gray, forever useless. | |  |
| 2 After absorbing fifty spell levels, the stone burns out and turns dull gray, forever useless. | |  |
Regeneration from the pearly white ioun stone works like a ring of regeneration. (It only cures damage taken while the character is using the stone.) The pale lavender and lavender and green stones work like a rod of absorption, but absorbing a spell requires a readied action, and these stones cannot be used to empower spells. Stored spells in the vibrant purple stone must be placed by a spellcaster but can be used by anyone (see ring of minor spell storing).</p>
<p>Moderate varied; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be 12th level.</p>
<p>Iron Bands of Binding: When initially discovered, this very potent item appears to be a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere with bandings on the globe.</p>
<p>When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and ruin) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 Escape Artist check. Iron bands of binding are usable once per day.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, grasping hand; Price 26,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Iron Flask: These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature. </p>
<p>The command word can be given only once per day.</p>
<p>If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. A newly discovered bottle might contain any of the following:</p>
<p>| d% | | Contents | | d% | | Contents | |  |
| 01-50 | | Empty | | 89 | | Demon (glabrezu) | |  |
| 51-54 | | Large air elemental | | 90 | | Demon (succubus) | |  |
| 55-58 | | Arrowhawk | | 91 | | Devil (osyluth) | |  |
| 59-62 | | Large earth elemental | | 92 | | Devil (barbazu) | |  |
| 63-66 | | Xorn | | 93 | | Devil (erinyes) | |  |
| 67-70 | | Large fire elemental | | 94 | | Devil (cornugon) | |  |
| 71-74 | | Salamander | | 95 | | Celestial (avoral) | |  |
| 75-78 | | Large water elemental | | 96 | | Celestial (ghaele) | |  |

| 83-84 | | Chaos Beast | | 98 | | Arrowhawk, elder | |  |
| 85-86 | | Formian taskmaster | | 99 | | Rakshasa | |  |
| 87 | | Demon (vrock) | | 100 | | Demon (balor) or devil (pit fiend)--equal chance for either | |  |

<p>Lantern of Revealing: This lantern operates as a normal hooded lantern. While it is lit, it also reveals all invisible creatures and objects within 25 feet of it, just like the spell invisibility purge.</p>
<p>Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, invisibility purge; Price 30,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.</p>
<p>Lens of Detection: This circular prism enables its user to detect minute details, granting a +5 bonus on Search checks.</p>
<p>It also aids in following tracks, adding a +5 bonus on Survival checks when tracking. The lens is about 6 inches in diameter and set in a frame with a handle.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Price 3,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Lyre of Building: If the proper chords are struck, a single use of this lyre negates any attacks made against all inanimate construction (walls, roof, floor, and so on) within 300 feet. This includes the effects of a horn of blasting, a disintegrate spell, or an attack from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, or whatever. The effect produced in but 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring for three days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre must make a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check. If it fails, she must stop and cannot play the lyre again for this purpose until a week has passed.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate; Price 13,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Mantle of Faith: This holy garment, worn over normal clothing, grants damage reduction 5/evil to the character wearing it.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration [good]; CL 20th; Craft Wondrous Item, stoneskin; Price 76,000 gp.</p>
<p>Mantle of Spell Resistance: This garment, worn over normal clothing or armor, grants the wearer spell resistance 21.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, spell resistance; Price 90,000 gp.</p>
<p>Manual of Bodily Health: This thick tome contains tips on health and fitness, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, he gains an inherent bonus of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of manual) to his Constitution score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book.</p>
<p>Strong evocation (if miracle is used); CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, wish or miracle; Price 27,500 gp (+1), 55,000 gp (+2), 82,500 gp (+3), 110,000 gp (+4), 137,500 gp (+5); Cost 1,250 gp + 5,100 XP (+1), 2,500 gp + 10,200 XP (+2), 3,750 gp + 15,300 XP (+3), 5,000 gp + 20,400 XP (+4), 6,250 gp + 25,500 XP (+5); Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Manual of Gainful Exercise: This thick tome contains exercise descriptions and diet suggestions, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, she gains an inherent bonus of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of manual) to her Strength score.

<p>Marvelous Pigments: These magic emulsions enable their possessor to create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the desired image. One pot of marvelous pigments is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface. </p>
<p>Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can't be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface. It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object with the pigments. Marvelous pigments cannot create magic items. Objects of value depicted by the pigments --precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on-- appear to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead, paste, brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item (including foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp.</p>
<p>Items created are not magical; the effect is instantaneous.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, major creation; Price 4,000 gp.</p>
<p>Mask of the Skull: This ivory mask has been fashioned into the likeness of a human skull. Once per day, after it has been worn for at least 1 hour, the mask can be loosed to fly from the wearer's face. It travels up to 50 feet away from the wearer and attacks a target assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch attack against the target based on the wearer's base attack bonus. If the attack succeeds, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be struck dead, as if affected by a finger of death spell. If the target succeeds on his saving throw, he nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of damage. After attacking (whether successful or not), the mask flies back to its user. The mask has AC 16, 10 hit points, and hardness 6.</p>
<p>Strong necromancy and transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, finger of death, fly; Price 22,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Mattock of the Titans: This digging tool is 10 feet long. Any creature of at least Huge size can use it to loosen or tumble earth or earthen ramparts (a 10-foot cube every 10 minutes). It also smashes rock (a 10-foot cube per hour). If used as a weapon, it is the equivalent of a Gargantuan +3 adamantine warhammer, dealing 4d6 points of base damage.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 16th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, move earth; Price 23,348 gp; Cost 13,348 gp + 800 XP; Weight 120 lb.</p>
<p>Maul of the Titans: This mallet is 8 feet long. If used as a weapon, it is the equivalent of a +3 greatclub and deals triple damage against inanimate objects. However, the wielder must have a Strength of at least 18 to wield it properly. Otherwise, she takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, clenched fist; Price 25,305 gp; Cost 12,305 gp + 480 XP; Weight 160 lb.</p>
<p>Medallion of Thoughts: This appears to be a normal pendant disk hung from a neck chain. Usually fashioned from bronze, copper, or nickel-silver, the medallion allows the wearer to read the thoughts of others, as with the spell detect thoughts.</p>
<p>Faint divination; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts; Price 12,000 gp.</p>
<p>Mirror of Life Trapping: This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has fifteen nonspatial extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).</p>
<p>When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.</p>
<p>If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is broken, all victims currently trapped in it are freed.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, imprisonment; Price 200,000 gp;Weight 50 lb.</p>
<p>Mirror of Mental Prowess: This mirror resembles an ordinary looking glass 5 feet tall by 2 feet wide. The possessor who knows the proper commands can cause it to perform as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the owner is within 25 feet of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View other places as if with clairvoyance, but vision extends even onto other planes if the viewer is sufficiently familiar with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use it as a portal to visit other places. The user first views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a scrying spell. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface (giving answers similar to those from the legend lore spell).</p>

<p>Strong conjuration and divination; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, gate, legend lore; Price 175,000 gp; Weight 40 lb.</p>
<p>Mirror of Opposition: This item resembles a normal mirror about 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by speaking a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection in the mirror's surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being. This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and her items disappear completely. The mirror functions up to four times per day.</p>
<p>Strong necromancy; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, clone; Price 92,000 gp;Weight 45 lb.</p>
<p>Necklace of Adaptation: This necklace is a heavy chain with a platinum medallion. The magic of the necklace wraps the wearer in a shell of fresh air, making him immune to all harmful vapors and gases (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, as well as inhaled poisons) and allowing him to breathe, even underwater or in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, alter self; Price 9,000 gp.</p>
<p>Necklace of Fireballs: This device appears to be nothing but beads on a string, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is--a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half ).</p>
<p>Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The market price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.</p>
<p>Each necklace of fireballs contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed below.</p>
<p>| Necklace | | 10d6 | 9d6 | 8d6 | 7d6 | 6d6 | 5d6 | 4d6 | 3d6 | 2d6 | | Market Price | |  |
| Type I | | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | 1 | -- | 2 | -- | | 1,650 gp | |  |

If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, fireball. </p>
<p>Orb of Storms: This glass sphere is 8 inches in diameter. The possessor can call forth all manner of weather, even supernaturally destructive storms. Once per day she can call upon the orb to use a control weather spell, Once per month, she can conjure a storm of vengeance. The possessor of the orb is continually protected by an endure elements effect.</p>
<p>Strong varied; CL 18th; Craft Wondrous Item, control weather, endure elements, storm of vengeance; Price 48,000 gp;Weight 6 lb.</p>
<p>Pearl of Power: This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a pearl of power enables the possessor to recall any one spell that she had prepared and then cast. The spell is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. The spell must be of a particular level, depending on the pearl. Different pearls exist for recalling one spell per day of each level from 1st through 9th and for the recall of two spells per day (each of a different level, 6th or lower).</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be able to cast spells of the spell level to be recalled; Price 1,000 gp (1st), 4,000 gp (2nd), 9,000 gp (3rd), 16,000 gp (4th), 25,000 gp (5th), 36,000 gp (6th), 49,000 gp (7th), 64,000 gp (8th), 81,000 gp (9th), or 70,000 gp (two spells).</p>
<p>Pearl of the Sirines: This normal-seeming pearl is beautiful and worth at least 1,000 gp on that basis alone. If it is clasped firmly in hand or held to the breast while the possessor attempts actions related to the pearl's powers, she understands and is able to employ the item.</p>
<p>The pearl enables its possessor to breathe in water as if she were in clean, fresh air. Her swim speed is 60 feet, and she can cast spells and act underwater without hindrance.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration and transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, freedom of movement, water breathing; Price 15,300 gp.</p>
<p>Periapt of Health: The wearer of this blue gem on a silver chain is immune to disease, including supernatural diseases.</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, remove disease; Price 7,500 gp.</p>
<p>Periapt of Proof against Poison: This item is a brilliant-cut black gem on a delicate silver chain. The wearer is immune to poison, although poisons still active when the periapt is first donned still run their course.</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, neutralize poison; Price 27,000 gp.</p>
<p>Periapt of Wisdom: Although it appears to be a normal pearl on a light chain, a periapt of wisdom actually increases the possessor's Wisdom score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +2, +4, or +6 (depending on the individual item).</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, owl's wisdom; Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).</p>
<p>Periapt of Wound Closure: This stone is bright red and dangles on a gold chain. The wearer of this periapt automatically becomes stable if his hit points drop to between -1 and -9 inclusive. The periapt doubles the wearer's normal rate of healing or allows normal healing of wounds that would not do so normally. Hit point damage that involves bleeding is negated for the wearer of the periapt, but he is still susceptible to damage from bleeding that causes Constitution loss, such as that dealt by a wounding weapon.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, heal; Price 15,000 gp.</p>
<p>Phylactery of Faithfulness: This item is a small box containing religious scripture affixed to a leather cord and tied around the forehead. There is no mundane way to determine what function this religious item performs until it is worn. The wearer of a phylactery of faithfulness is aware of any action or item that could adversely affect his alignment and his standing with his deity, including magical effects. He acquires this information prior to performing such an action or becoming associated with such an item if he takes a moment to contemplate the act.</p>
<p>Faint divination; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law; Price 1,000 gp.</p>
<p>Phylactery of Undead Turning: This item is a boon to any character able to turn undead, allowing him to do so as if his class level were four levels higher than it actually is.</p>
<p>Moderate necromancy [good]; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, 10th-level cleric; Price 11,000 gp.</p>
<p>Pipes of Haunting: This magic item appears to be a small set of pan pipes. When played by a person who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Those within 30 feet who hear the tune must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or become frightened for 4 rounds. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are unaffected. Pipes of haunting can be sounded twice a day.</p>
<p>Faint necromancy; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, scare; Price 6,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Pipes of Pain: These appear to be like any other standard set of pipes with nothing to reveal their true nature. When played by someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create a wondrous melody. All within 30 feet must make a DC 14 Will save or be fascinated by the sound. (This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion.)</p>
<p>As soon as the piping stops, all those affected are stricken by intense pain at even the slightest noise. Unless a character is in a totally silent area, she takes 1d4 points of damage per round for 2d4 rounds. During this time, damage from sonic attacks is doubled. Thereafter, the least noise causes an affected character to become shaken (except when she is in a totally silent area). This hypersensitivity is a curse and therefore hard to remove (see the bestow curse spell).</p>
<p>Faint enchantment and evocation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must have the bardic music class feature, sound burst; Price 12,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Pipes of the Sewers: These wooden pipes appear ordinary, but if the possessor learns the proper tune, he can attract 1d3 rat swarms if rats are within 400 feet. For each 50-foot distance the rats have to travel, there is a 1-round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10 Perform (wind instruments) check. Success means that they obey the piper's telepathic commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately. If they are called again within a day, the Perform check DC is 15.</p>
<p>If the rats are under the control of another creature, add the HD of the controller to the Perform check DC. Once control is assumed, another check is required each round to maintain it if the other creature is actively seeking to reassert its control.</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, charm animal, summon nature's ally I, wild empathy ability; Price 1,150 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Pipes of Sounding: When played by a character who has the Perform (wind instruments) skill, these pipes create a variety of sounds. The figment sounds are the equivalent of ghost sound (caster level 2nd).</p>
<p>Faint illusion; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, ghost sound; Price 1,800 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Portable Hole: A portable hole is a circle of cloth spun from the webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of starlight. When opened fully, a portable hole is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains.</p>
<p>The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth does not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled. Each portable hole opens on its own particular nondimensional space. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the portable hole and bag of holding being destroyed in the process.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift; Price 20,000 gp.</p>
<p>Restorative Ointment: A jar of this unguent is 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch deep and contains five applications. Placed upon a poisoned wound or swallowed, the ointment detoxifies any poison (as neutralize poison). Applied to a diseased area, it removes disease (as remove disease). Rubbed on a wound, the ointment cures 1d8+5 points of damage (as cure light wounds).</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 5th;Craft Wondrous Item, cure light wounds, neutralize poison, remove disease; Price 4,000 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>Ring Gates: These always come in pairs--two iron rings, each about 18 inches in diameter. The rings must be on the same plane of existence and within 100 miles of each other to function. Whatever is put through one ring comes out the other, and up to 100 pounds of material can be transferred each day. (Objects only partially pushed through and then retracted do not count.) This useful device allows for instantaneous transport of items or messages, and even attacks. A character can reach through to grab things near the other ring, or even stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could stick his head through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a spell through a ring gate. A Small character can make a DC 13 Escape Artist check to slip through. Creatures of Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine size can pass through easily. Each ring has a &quot;entry side&quot; and an &quot;exit side,&quot; both marked with appropriate symbols.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, gate; Price 40,000 gp;Weight 1 lb. each.</p>
<p>Robe of the Archmagi: This normal-appearing garment can be white (01-45 on d%, good alignment), gray (46-75, neither good nor evil alignment), or black (76-100, evil alignment). Its wearer, if an arcane spellcaster, gains the following powers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>+5 armor bonus to AC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spell resistance 18.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>+4 resistance bonus on all saving throws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>+2 enhancement bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a white robe is donned by an evil character, she immediately gains three negative levels. The reverse is true with respect to a black robe donned by a good character. An evil or good character who puts on a gray robe, or a neutral character who dons either a white or black robe, gains two negative levels. While these negative levels never result in lost levels, they remain as long as the garment is worn and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells).</p>
<p>Strong varied; CL 14th; Craft Wondrous Item, antimagic field, mage armor or shield of faith, creator must be of same alignment as robe; Price 75,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Robe of Blending: When this robe is put on, the wearer intuitively knows that the garment has very special properties. A robe of blending enables its wearer to appear to be part of his surroundings. This allows him a +10 competence bonus on Hide checks. The wearer can adopt the appearance of another creature, as with the disguise self spell, at will. All creatures acquainted with and friendly to the wearer see him normally.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self; Price 30,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Robe of Bones: This handy item functions much like a robe of useful items for the serious necromancer. It appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small embroidered figures representing undead creatures. Only the wearer of the robe can see the embroidery and recognize them for the creatures they become, and detach them. One figure can be detached each round. Detaching a figure causes it to become an actual undead creature (see the list below). The skeleton or zombie is not under the control of the wearer of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked, turned, or destroyed. A newly created robe of bones always has two embroidered figures of each of the following undead:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Small goblin skeleton</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medium human commoner skeleton</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medium wolf skeleton</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small goblin zombie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medium human commoner zombie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medium wolf zombie</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moderate necromancy [evil]; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate dead; Price 2,400 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Robe of Eyes: This valuable garment appears to be a normal robe until it is put on. Its wearer is able to see in all directions at the same moment due to scores of visible, magical eyelike patterns that adorn the robe. She also gains 120-foot darkvision.</p>
<p>The robe of eyes sees all forms of invisible or ethereal things within 120 feet.</p>
<p>The wearer of a robe of eyes gains a +10 competence bonus on Search checks and Spot checks. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed, and she can't be flanked. However, she is not able to avert her eyes or close her eyes when confronted by a creature with a gaze attack.</p>
<p>A light or continual flame spell cast directly on a robe of eyes causes it to be blinded for 1d3 minutes. A daylight spell blinds it for 2d4 minutes.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Price 120,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Robe of Scintillating Colors: The wearer of this robe can cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of incredible hues, color after color cascading from the upper part of the robe to the hem in sparkling rainbows of dazzling light. The colors daze those near the wearer, conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings. It takes 1 full round after the wearer speaks the command word for the colors to start flowing on the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze attack with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are dazed for 1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting pattern effect.</p>
<p>Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives the wearer better concealment. The miss chance on attacks against the wearer starts at 10% and increases by 10% each round until it reaches 50% (total concealment).</p>
<p>The robe illuminates a 30-foot radius continuously.</p>
<p>The effect can be used no more than a total of 10 rounds per day.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, blur, rainbow pattern; Price 27,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Robe of Stars: This garment is typically black or dark blue and embroidered with small white or silver stars. The robe has three magical powers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It enables its wearer to travel physically to the Astral Plane, along with all that she is wearing or carrying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It gives its wearer a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its wearer can use up to six of the embroidered stars on the chest portion of the robe as +5 shuriken. The robe grants its wearer proficiency with such weapons. Each shuriken disappears after it is used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Strong varied; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, magic missile, astral projection or plane shift; Price 58,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Robe of Useful Items: This appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small cloth patches of various shapes. Only the wearer of the robe can see these patches, recognize them for what items they become, and detach them. One patch can be detached each round. Detaching a patch causes it to become an actual item, as indicated below. A newly created robe of useful items always has two each of the following patches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dagger</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mirror (a highly polished 2-foot-by-4-foot steel mirror)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pole (10-foot length)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hempen rope (50-foot coil)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sack</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the robe has several other patches. Roll 4d4 for the number of other patches and then roll for each patch on the table below to determine its nature.</p>
<p>| d% | | Result | |  |
| 01-08 | | Bag of 100 gold pieces | |  |
| 09-15 | | Coffer, silver (6 in. by 6 in. by 1 ft.), 500 gp value | |  |
| 16-22 | | Door, iron (up to 10 ft. wide and 10 ft. high and barred on one side--must be placed upright, attaches and hinges itself) | |  |
| 23-30 | | Gems, 10 (100 gp value each) | |  |
| 31-44 | | Ladder, wooden (24 ft. long) | |  |
| 45-51 | | Mule (with saddle bags) | |  |
| 52-59 | | Pit, open (10 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft.) | |  |
| 60-68 | | Potion of cure serious wounds | |  |
| 69-75 | | Rowboat (12 ft. long) | |  |
| 76-83 | | Minor scroll of one randomly determined spell | |  |
| 84-90 | | War dogs, pair (treat as riding dogs) | |  |
| 91-96 | | Window (2 ft. by 4 ft., up to 2 ft. deep) | |  |
| 97-100 | | Portable ram | |  |
Multiple items of the same kind are permissible. Once removed, a patch cannot be replaced.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate; Price 7,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Rope of Climbing: A 60-foot-long rope of climbing is no thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other direction at 10 feet per round, attaching itself securely wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner.</p>
<p>A rope of climbing can be commanded to knot or unknot itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are untied but lowers the DC of Climb checks while using it by 10. A creature must hold one end of the rope when its magic is invoked.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, animate rope; Price 3,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p>Rope of Entanglement: A rope of entanglement looks just like any other hempen rope about 30 feet long. Upon command, the rope lashes forward 20 feet or upward 10 feet to entangle a victim. An entangled creature can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check.</p>
<p>The rope has AC 22, 12 hit points, and hardness 10, and it has damage reduction 5/slashing as well. The rope repairs damage to itself at a rate of 1 point per 5 minutes, but if a rope of entanglement is severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, animate rope, entangle; Price 21,000 gp; Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Salve of Slipperiness: This substance provides a +20 competence bonus on all Escape Artist checks, meaning that it is almost impossible to grapple such a character or to tie or chain him up. In addition, such obstructions as webs (magical or otherwise) do not affect an anointed individual. Magic ropes and the like do not avail against this salve. If it is smeared on a floor or on steps, the area should be treated as a long-lasting grease spell. The salve requires 8 hours to wear off normally, or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine).</p>
<p>Salve of slipperiness is needed to coat the inside of a container that is meant to hold sovereign glue (see below).</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, grease; Price 1,000 gp.</p>
<p>Scabbard of Keen Edges: This scabbard is fashioned from cured leather and fine silver. It can shrink or enlarge to accommodate any knife, dagger, sword, or similar weapon up to and including a greatsword. Up to three times per day on command, the scabbard casts keen edge on any blade placed within it.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, keen edge; Price 16,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p>Scarab of Protection: This device appears to be a silver medallion in the shape of a beetle. If it is held for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface letting the holder know that it is a protective device.</p>
<p>The scarab's possessor gains spell resistance 20. The scarab can also absorb energy-draining attacks, death effects, and negative energy effects. Upon absorbing twelve such attacks, the scarab turns to powder and is destroyed.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration and necromancy; CL 18th; Craft Wondrous Item, death ward, spell resistance; Price 38,000 gp.</p>
<p>Scarab, Golembane: This beetle-shaped pin enables its wearer to detect any golem within 60 feet, although he must concentrate (a standard action) in order for the detection to take place. A scarab enables its possessor to combat golems with weapons, unarmed attacks, or natural weapons as if those golems had no damage reduction.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect magic, creator must be at least 10th level; Price 2,500 gp.</p>
<p>Shrouds of Disintegration: These burial wrappings look to be made of fine, embroidered materials. When a body is placed inside, a command word will turn it to dust. The magic of the shrouds is usable only once, after which the wrappings become ordinary, fine cloth.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, disintegrate; Price 6,600 gp; Weight 10 lb.</p>
<p>Silversheen: This substance can be applied to a weapon as a standard action. It will give the weapon the properties of alchemical silver for 1 hour, replacing the properties of any other special material it might have. One vial will coat a single melee weapon or 20 units of ammunition.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item; Price 250 gp.</p>
<p>Slippers of Spider Climbing: When worn, a pair of these slippers enable movement on vertical surfaces or even upside down along ceilings, leaving the wearer's hands free. Her speed is 20 feet. Severely slippery surfaces--icy, oiled, or greased surfaces-- make these slippers useless. The slippers can be used for 10 minutes per day, split up as the wearer chooses.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, spider climb; Price 4,800 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.</p>
<p>Sovereign Glue: This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of salve of slipperiness, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the salve of slipperiness must be put in the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of sovereign glue, when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8-1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask's capacity taken up by the salve of slipperiness. One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except when universal solvent is applied to the bond. (Sovereign glue is dissolved by universal solvent.)</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 20th; Craft Wondrous Item, make whole; Price 2,400 gp (per ounce).</p>
<p>Stone of Alarm: This stone cube, when given the command word, affixes itself to any object. If that object is touched thereafter by anyone who does not first speak that same command word, the stone emits a piercing screech for 1 hour that can be heard up to a quarter-mile away (assuming no intervening barriers).</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, alarm; Price 2,700 gp;Weight 2 lb.</p>
<p>Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals: A stone of this nature is typically an oddly shaped bit of roughly polished rock.</p>
<p>The possessor of such a stone need but utter a few words of summoning, and a Huge earth elemental comes to the summoner. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak, and in all ways the stone functions as the summon monster VII spell. (If sand or rough, unhewn stone is the summoning medium, the elemental that comes is Large instead, and the stone functions as the summon monster VI spell.) The elemental appears in 1d4 rounds. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new patch of earth or stone, which cannot be accessed until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI, summon monster VII; Price 100,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone): This stone is typically a bit of rough polished agate or some similar mineral. Its possessor gains a +1 luck bonus on saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks.</p>
<p>Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, divine favor; Price 20,000 gp.</p>
<p>Stone Horse: Each item of this nature appears to be a fullsized, roughly hewn statue of a horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed to life, enabling it to carry a burden and even to attack as if it were a real horse of the appropriate kind.</p>
<p>A stone horse can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or feed. Damage dealt to it can be repaired by first using a stone to flesh spell, thus causing the stone horse to become a normal horse that can be healed normally. When fully healed, it automatically reverts to its stone form. While in its stone form, it can be fed gems, healing 1 point of damage for each 50 gp worth of mineral it is given.</p>
<p>There are two sorts of stone horses.</p>
<p>Courser: This item has the statistics of a heavy horse as well as having hardness 10.</p>
<p>Destrier: This item has the statistics of a heavy warhorse as well as having hardness 10.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 14th; Craft Wondrous Item, flesh to stone, animate objects; Price 10,000 gp (courser) or 14,800 gp (destrier);Weight 6,000 lb.</p>
<p>Stone Salve: This ointment has two uses. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a petrified creature, it returns the creature to flesh as the stone to flesh spell. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a nonpetrified creature, it protects the creature as a stoneskin spell.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration and transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, flesh to stone, stoneskin; Price 4,000 gp per ounce.</p>
<p>Strand of Prayer Beads: This item appears to be a normal string of prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell. Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the powers of the prayer beads and how to activate them. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic power.</p>
<p>| Special Bead Type | Special Bead Ability | |  |
| Bead of blessing | Wearer can cast bless. | |  |
| Bead of healing | Wearer can cast his choice of cure serious wounds, remove blindness/deafness, or remove disease. | |  |
| Bead of karma | Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes. | |  |
| Bead of smiting | Wearer can cast chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight (Will DC 17 partial). | |  |
| Bead of summons | Summons a powerful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for one day. (If the wearer uses the bead of summons to summon a deity's emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character's items and places a geas upon him as punishment in the very least.) | |  |
| Bead of wind walking | Wearer can cast wind walk. | |  |
A lesser strand of prayer beads has a bead of blessing and a bead of healing. A strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, and a bead of smiting. A greater strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, a bead of summons, and a bead of wind walking.</p>
<p>Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the bead of summons, which works only once and then becomes nonmagical. The beads of blessing, smiting, and wind walking function as spell trigger items; the beads of karma and summons can be activated by any character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the strand of prayer beads in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person.</p>
<p>The power of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand. Reduce the price of a strand of prayer beads that is missing one or more beads by the following amounts: bead of blessing -600 gp, bead of healing -9,000 gp, bead of karma -20,000 gp, bead of smiting -16,800 gp, bead of summons -20,000 gp, bead of wind walking -46,800 gp.</p>
<p>Faint, moderate or strong (many schools); CL 1st (blessing), 5th (healing), 7th (smiting), 9th (karma), 11th (wind walking), 17th (summons); Craft Wondrous Items and one of the following spells per bead, as appropriate: bless (blessing); cure serious wounds, remove blindness/ deafness, or remove disease (healing); righteous might (karma); gate (summons); chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight (smiting), wind walk (wind walking); Price 9,600 gp (lesser), 25,800 gp (standard), 95,800 gp (greater).</p>
<p>Sustaining Spoon: This unremarkable eating utensil is typically fashioned from horn. If the spoon is placed in an empty container the vessel fills with a thick, pasty gruel. Although this substance has a flavor similar to that of warm, wet cardboard, it is highly nourishing and contains everything necessary to sustain any herbivorous, omnivorous, or carnivorous creature. The spoon can produce sufficient gruel each day to feed up to four humans.</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, create food and water; Price 5,400 gp.</p>
<p>Tome of Clear Thought: This heavy book contains instruction on improving memory and logic, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, she gains an inherent bonus of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to her Intelligence score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book. Because the tome of clear thought provides an inherent bonus, the reader will earn extra skill points when she attains a new level.</p>
<p>Strong evocation (if miracle is used); CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, miracle or wish; Price 27,500 gp (+1), 55,000 gp (+2), 82,500 gp (+3), 110,000 gp (+4), 137,500 gp (+5); Cost 1,250 gp + 5,100 XP (+1), 2,500 gp + 10,200 XP (+2), 3,750 gp + 15,300 XP (+3), 5,000 gp + 20,400 XP (+4), 6,250 gp + 25,500 XP (+5); Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Tome of Leadership and Influence: This ponderous book details suggestions for persuading and inspiring others, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, he gains an inherent bonus of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to his Charisma score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book.</p>
<p>Strong evocation (if miracle is used); CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, miracle or wish; Price 27,500 gp (+1), 55,000 gp (+2), 82,500 gp (+3), 110,000 gp (+4), 137,500 gp (+5); Cost 1,250 gp + 5,100 XP (+1), 2,500 gp + 10,200 XP (+2), 3,750 gp + 15,300 XP (+3), 5,000 gp + 20,400 XP (+4), 6,250 gp + 25,500 XP (+5); Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Tome of Understanding: This thick book contains tips for improving instinct and perception, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, she gains an inherent bonus of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to her Wisdom score.

<p>Strong evocation (if miracle is used); CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, miracle or wish; Price 27,500 gp (+1), 55,000 gp (+2), 82,500 gp (+3), 110,000 gp (+4), 137,500 gp (+5); Cost 1,250 gp + 5,100 XP (+1), 2,500 gp + 10,200 XP (+2), 3,750 gp + 15,300 XP (+3), 5,000 gp + 20,400 XP (+4), 6,250 gp + 25,500 XP (+5); Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p>Unguent of Timelessness: When applied to any matter that was once alive this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of time. Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. The unguent never wears off, although it can be magically removed (by dispelling the effect, for instance). One flask contains enough material to coat eight Medium or smaller objects. A Large object counts as two Medium objects, and a Huge object counts as two Large objects.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Prerequisite: Craft Wondrous Item; Price 150 gp.</p>
<p>Universal Solvent: This substance has the unique property of being able to dissolve sovereign glue and tanglefoot bags. Applying the solvent is a standard action.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 20th; Craft Wondrous Item, disintegrate; Price 50 gp.</p>
<p>Vest of Escape: Hidden within secret pockets of this simple silk vest are lockpicks that provide a +4 competence bonus on Open Lock checks. The vest also grants its wearer a +6 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks.</p>
<p>Faint conjuration and transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, knock, grease; Price 5,200 gp.</p>
<p>Vestment, Druid's: This light garment is worn over normal clothing or armor. Most such vestments are green, embroidered with plant or animal motifs. When this item is worn by a character with the wild shape ability, the character can use that ability one additional time each day.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, polymorph or wild shape ability; Price 10,000 gp.</p>
<p>Well of Many Worlds: This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a portable hole. Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another world--a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, the random factor again comes into play. It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a portable hole can be. Objects from the world the well touches can come through the opening just as easily as from the initiating place. (It is a two-way portal.)</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, gate; Price 82,000 gp.</p>
<p>Wind Fan: A wind fan appears to be nothing more than a wood and papyrus or cloth instrument with which to create a cooling breeze. By uttering the command word, its possessor causes the fan to generate air movement duplicating a gust of wind spell. The fan can be used once per day with no risk. If it is used more frequently, there is a 20% cumulative chance per usage during that day that the device tears into useless, nonmagical tatters.</p>
<p>Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, gust of wind; Price 5,500 gp.</p>
<p>Wings of Flying: A pair of these wings might appear to be nothing more than a plain cloak of old, black cloth, or they could be as elegant as a long cape of blue feathers. When the wearer speaks the command word, the cloak turns into a pair of bat or bird wings that empower her to fly with a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability).</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, fly; Price 54,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="magic-item-creation"><a class="header" href="#magic-item-creation">Magic Item Creation</a></h1>
<p>To create magic items, spellcasters use special feats. They invest time, money, and their own personal energy (in the form of experience points) in an item's creation.</p>
<p>Note that all items have prerequisites in their descriptions. These prerequisites must be met for the item to be created. Most of the time, they take the form of spells that must be known by the item's creator (although access through another magic item or spellcaster is allowed).</p>
<p>While item creation costs are handled in detail below, note that normally the two primary factors are the caster level of the creator and the level of the spell or spells put into the item. A creator can create an item at a lower caster level than her own, but never lower than the minimum level needed to cast the needed spell. Using metamagic feats, a caster can place spells in items at a higher level than normal.</p>
<p>Magic supplies for items are always half of the base price in gp and 1/25 of the base price in XP. For many items, the market price equals the base price.</p>
<p>Armor, shields, weapons, and items with a value independent of their magically enhanced properties add their item cost to the market price. The item cost does not influence the base price (which determines the cost of magic supplies and the experience point cost), but it does increase the final market price.</p>
<p>In addition, some items cast or replicate spells with costly material components or with XP components. For these items, the market price equals the base price plus an extra price for the spell component costs. Each XP in the component costs adds 5 gp to the market price. The cost to create these items is the magic supplies cost and the base XP cost (both determined by the base price) plus the costs for the components. Descriptions of these items include an entry that gives the total cost of creating the item.</p>
<p>The creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well-lit place in which to work. Any place suitable for preparing spells is suitable for making items. Creating an item requires one day per 1,000 gp in the item's base price, with a minimum of at least one day. Potions are an exception to this rule; they always take just one day to brew. The character must spend the gold and XP at the beginning of the construction process.</p>
<p>The caster works for 8 hours each day. He cannot rush the process by working longer each day. But the days need not be consecutive, and the caster can use the rest of his time as he sees fit.</p>
<p>A character can work on only one item at a time. If a character starts work on a new item, all materials used and XP spent on the under-construction item are wasted.</p>
<p>The secrets of creating artifacts are long lost.</p>

<h2 id="magic-item-gold-piece-values"><a class="header" href="#magic-item-gold-piece-values">Magic Item Gold Piece Values</a></h2>
<p>Many factors must be considered when determining the price of new magic items. The easiest way to come up with a price is to match the new item to an item that is already priced that price as a guide. Otherwise, use the guidelines summarized on Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Similar Abilities:</strong> For items with multiple similar abilities that don't take up space on a character's body use the following formula: Calculate the price of the single most costly ability, then add 75% of the value of the next most costly ability, plus one-half the value of any other abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Different Abilities:</strong> Abilities such as an attack roll bonus or saving throw bonus and a spell-like function are not similar, and their values are simply added together to determine the cost. For items that do take up a space on a character's body each additional power not only has no discount but instead has a 50% increase in price.</p>
<p><strong>0th-Level Spells:</strong> When multiplying spell levels to determine value, 0- level spells should be treated as 1/2 level.</p>
<p><strong>Other Considerations:</strong> Once you have a final cost figure, reduce that number if either of the following conditions applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item Requires Skill to Use: Some items require a specific skill to get them to function. This factor should reduce the cost about 10%.</li>
<li>Item Requires Specific Class or Alignment to Use: Even more restrictive than requiring a skill, this limitation cuts the cost by 30%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prices presented in the magic item descriptions (the gold piece value following the item's caster level) are the market value, which is generally twice what it costs the creator to make the item.</p>
<p>Since different classes get access to certain spells at different levels, the prices for two characters to make the same item might actually be different. An item is only worth two times what the caster of lowest possible level can make it for. Calculate the market price based on the lowest possible level caster, no matter who makes the item.</p>
<p>Not all items adhere to these formulas directly. The reasons for this are several. First and foremost, these few formulas aren't enough to truly gauge the exact differences between items. The price of a magic item may be modified based on its actual worth. The formulas only provide a starting point. The pricing of scrolls assumes that, whenever possible, a wizard or cleric created it. Potions and wands follow the formulas exactly. Staffs follow the formulas closely, and other items require at least some judgment calls.</p>
<h2 id="masterwork-items"><a class="header" href="#masterwork-items">Masterwork Items</a></h2>
<p>Masterwork items are extraordinarily well-made items. They are more expensive, but they benefit the user with improved quality. They are not magical in any way. However, only masterwork items may be enhanced to become magic armor and weapons. (Items that are not weapons or armor may or may not be masterwork items.)</p>
<h2 id="creating-magic-armor"><a class="header" href="#creating-magic-armor">Creating Magic Armor</a></h2>
<p>To create magic armor, a character needs a heat source and some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. He also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the armor or the pieces of the armor to be assembled. Armor to be made into magic armor must be masterwork armor, and the masterwork cost is added to the base price to determine final market value. Additional magic supplies costs for the materials are subsumed in the cost for creating the magic armor--half the base price of the item.</p>
<p>Creating magic armor has a special prerequisite: The creator's caster level must be at least three times the enhancement bonus of the armor. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>
<p>Magic armor or a magic shield must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus to have any of the abilities listed on Table: Armor Special Abilities and Table: Shield Special Abilities.</p>
<p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the armor, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard), must provide any material components or focuses the spells require, and must pay any XP costs required for the spells. The act of working on the armor triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the armor's creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)</p>
<p>Creating some armor may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>Crafting magic armor requires one day for each 1,000 gp value of the base price.</p>
<p>Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Magic Arms and Armor.</p>
<h2 id="creating-magic-weapons"><a class="header" href="#creating-magic-weapons">Creating Magic Weapons</a></h2>
<p>To create a magic weapon, a character needs a heat source and some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. She also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the weapon or the pieces of the weapon to be assembled. Only a masterwork weapon can become a magic weapon, and the masterwork cost is added to the total cost to determine final market value. Additional magic supplies costs for the materials are subsumed in the cost for creating the magic weapon--half the base price given on Table: Weapons, according to the weapon's total effective bonus.</p>
<p>Creating a magic weapon has a special prerequisite: The creator's caster level must be at least three times the enhancement bonus of the weapon. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>
<p>A magic weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus to have any of the abilities listed on Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities or Table Ranged Weapon Special Abilities.</p>
<p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the weapon, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not provide any material components or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of the item. The act of working on the weapon triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the weapon's creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)</p>
<p>At the time of creation, the creator must decide if the weapon glows or not as a side-effect of the magic imbued within it. This decision does not affect the price or the creation time, but once the item is finished, the decision is binding.</p>
<p>Creating magic double-headed weapons is treated as creating two weapons when determining cost, time, XP, and special abilities.</p>
<p>Creating some weapons may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>Crafting a magic weapon requires one day for each 1,000 gp value of the base price.</p>
<p>Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Magic Arms and Armor.</p>
<h2 id="creating-potions"><a class="header" href="#creating-potions">Creating Potions</a></h2>
<p>The creator of a potion needs a level working surface and at least a few containers in which to mix liquids, as well as a source of heat to boil the brew. In addition, he needs ingredients. The costs for materials and ingredients are subsumed in the cost for brewing the potion--25 gp x? the level of the spell x ?the level of the caster.</p>
<p>All ingredients and materials used to brew a potion must be fresh and unused. The character must pay the full cost for brewing each potion. (Economies of scale do not apply.)</p>
<p>The imbiber of the potion is both the caster and the target. Spells with a range of personal cannot be made into potions.</p>
<p>The creator must have prepared the spell to be placed in the potion (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and must provide any material component or focus the spell requires.</p>
<p>If casting the spell would reduce the caster's XP total, he pays the XP cost upon beginning the brew in addition to the XP cost for making the potion itself. Material components are consumed when he begins working, but a focus is not. (A focus used in brewing a potion can be reused.) The act of brewing triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for casting until the character has rested and regained spells.

<h2 id="creating-rings"><a class="header" href="#creating-rings">Creating Rings</a></h2>
<p>To create a magic ring, a character needs a heat source. He also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a ring or the pieces of the ring to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the ring. Ring costs are difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the ring prices in the ring descriptions as a guideline. Creating a ring generally costs half the ring's market price.</p>
<p>Rings that duplicate spells with costly material or XP components add in the value of 50 x the spell's component cost. Having a spell with a costly component as a prerequisite does not automatically incur this cost. The act of working on the ring triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the ring's creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)</p>
<p>Creating some rings may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>Forging a ring requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p>

<h2 id="creating-rods"><a class="header" href="#creating-rods">Creating Rods</a></h2>
<p>To create a magic rod, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a rod or the pieces of the rod to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the rod. Rod costs are difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the rod prices in the rod descriptions as a guideline. Creating a rod costs half the market value listed.</p>
<p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the rod, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not provide any material components or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of the item. The act of working on the rod triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the rod's creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)</p>

<h2 id="creating-scrolls"><a class="header" href="#creating-scrolls">Creating Scrolls</a></h2>
<p>To create a scroll, a character needs a supply of choice writing materials, the cost of which is subsumed in the cost for scribing the scroll--12.5 gp x the level of the spell x the level of the caster.</p>
<p>All writing implements and materials used to scribe a scroll must be fresh and unused. A character must pay the full cost for scribing each spell scroll no matter how many times she previously has scribed the same spell.</p>
<p>The creator must have prepared the spell to be scribed (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and must provide any material component or focus the spell requires. If casting the spell would reduce the caster's XP total, she pays the cost upon beginning the scroll in addition to the XP cost for making the scroll itself. Likewise, a material component is consumed when she begins writing, but a focus is not. (A focus used in scribing a scroll can be reused.) The act of writing triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for casting until the character has rested and regained spells. (That is, that spell slot is expended from her currently prepared spells, just as if it had been cast.)</p>

<h2 id="creating-staffs"><a class="header" href="#creating-staffs">Creating Staffs</a></h2>
<p>To create a magic staff, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a staff or the pieces of the staff to be assembled.</p>
<p>The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the staff--375 gp x the level of the highest-level spell x the level of the caster, plus 75% of the value of the next most costly ability (281.25 gp x the level of the spell x the level of the caster), plus one-half of the value of any other abilities (187.5 gp x the level of the spell x the level of the caster). Staffs are always fully charged (50 charges) when created.</p>
<p>If desired, a spell can be placed into the staff at only half the normal cost, but then activating that particular spell costs 2 charges from the staff. The caster level of all spells in a staff must be the same, and no staff can have a caster level of less than 8th, even if all the spells in the staff are low-level spells.</p>
<p>The creator must have prepared the spells to be stored (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and must provide any focus the spells require as well as material and XP component costs sufficient to activate the spell a maximum number of times (50 divided by the number of charges one use of the spell expends). This is in addition to the XP cost for making the staff itself. Material components are consumed when he begins working, but focuses are not. (A focus used in creating a staff can be reused.) The act of working on the staff triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the staff 's creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)</p>
<p>Creating a few staffs may entail other prerequisites beyond spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>Crafting a staff requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p>

<h2 id="creating-wands"><a class="header" href="#creating-wands">Creating Wands</a></h2>
<p>To create a magic wand, a character needs a small supply of materials, the most obvious being a baton or the pieces of the wand to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the wand--375 gp x the level of the spell x the level of the caster. Wands are always fully charged (50 charges) when created.</p>
<p>The creator must have prepared the spell to be stored (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and must provide any focuses the spell requires. Fifty of each needed material component are required, one for each charge. If casting the spell would reduce the caster's XP total, she pays the cost (multiplied by 50) upon beginning the wand in addition to the XP cost for making the wand itself. Likewise, material components are consumed when she begins working, but focuses are not. (A focus used in creating a wand can be reused.) The act of working on the wand triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for casting during each day devoted to the wand's creation. (That is, that spell slot is expended from her currently prepared spells, just as if it had been cast.)</p>

<h2 id="creating-wondrous-items"><a class="header" href="#creating-wondrous-items">Creating Wondrous Items</a></h2>
<p>To create a wondrous item, a character usually needs some sort of equipment or tools to work on the item. She also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the item to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the item. Wondrous item costs are difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the item prices in the item descriptions as a guideline. Creating an item costs half the market value listed.</p>
<p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the item, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not provide any material components or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of the item.

<p>Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Wondrous Item.</p>
<h2 id="intelligent-item-creation"><a class="header" href="#intelligent-item-creation">Intelligent Item Creation</a></h2>
<p>To create an intelligent item, a character must have a caster level of 15th or higher. Time and creation cost are based on the normal item creation rules, with the market price values on Table: Item Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Capabilities treated as additions to time, gp cost, and XP cost. The item's alignment is the same as its creator's. Determine other features randomly, following the guidelines in the relevant section.</p>
<h2 id="adding-new-abilities"><a class="header" href="#adding-new-abilities">Adding New Abilities</a></h2>
<p>A creator can add new magical abilities to a magic item with no restrictions. The cost to do this is the same as if the item was not magical. Thus, a +1 longsword can be made into a +2 vorpal longsword, with the cost to create it being equal to that of a +2 vorpal sword minus the cost of a +1 sword.</p>
<p>If the item is one that occupies a specific place on a character's body the cost of adding any additional ability to that item increases by 50%. For example, if a character adds the power to confer invisibility to her ring of protection +2, the cost of adding this ability is the same as for creating a ring of invisibility multiplied by 1.5.</p>
<h2 id="body-slot-affinities"><a class="header" href="#body-slot-affinities">Body Slot Affinities</a></h2>
<p>Each location on the body, or body slot, has one or more affinities: a word or phrase that describes the general function or nature of magic items designed for that body slot. Body slot affinities are deliberately broad, abstract categorizations, because a hard-and-fast rule can't cover the great variety among wondrous items.</p>
<p>You can use the affinities in the list below to guide your decisions on which magic items should be allowed in which body slots. And when you design your own magic items, the affinities give you some guidance for what form a particular item should take.</p>
<p>Some body slots have different affinities for different specific items. </p>
<p>| Body Slot | Affinity | |  |
| Headband, helmet | Mental improvement, ranged attacks | |  |
| Hat | Interaction | |  |
| Phylactery | Morale, alignment | |  |
| Eye lenses, goggles | Vision | |  |
| Cloak, cape, mantle | Transformation, protection | |  |
| Amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, scarab | Protection, discernment | |  |
| Robe  | Multiple effects | |  |
| Shirt  | Physical improvement | |  |
| Vest, vestment  | Class ability improvement | |  |
| Bracers  | Combat | |  |
| Bracelets  | Allies | |  |
| Gloves  | Quickness | |  |
| Gauntlets  | Destructive power | |  |
| Belt  | Physical improvement | |  |
| Boots  | Movement | |  |
Wondrous items that don't match the affinity for a particular body slot should cost 50% more than wondrous items that match the affinity.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="intelligent-items-1"><a class="header" href="#intelligent-items-1">Intelligent Items</a></h1>
<p>Magic items sometimes have intelligence of their own. Magically imbued with sentience, these items think and feel the same way characters do and should be treated as NPCs. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to single-use items or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.) In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence.</p>
<p>Intelligent items can actually be considered creatures because they have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Treat them as constructs. Intelligent items often have the ability to illuminate their surroundings at will (as magic weapons do); many cannot see otherwise.</p>
<p>Unlike most magic items, intelligent items can activate their own powers without waiting for a command word from their owner. Intelligent items act during their owner's turn in the initiative order.</p>
<h2 id="intelligent-item-alignment"><a class="header" href="#intelligent-item-alignment">Intelligent Item Alignment</a></h2>
<p>Any item with intelligence has an alignment. Note that intelligent weapons already have alignments, either stated or by implication.  If you're generating a random intelligent weapon, that weapon's alignment must fit with any alignment-oriented special abilities it has.</p>
<p>Any character whose alignment does not correspond to that of the item (except as noted by the asterisks on the table) gains one negative level if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this negative level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells). This negative level is cumulative with any other penalties the item might already place on inappropriate wielders. Items with Ego scores (see below) of 20 to 29 bestow two negative levels. Items with Ego scores of 30 or higher bestow three negative levels.</p>
<p>| Intelligent Item Alignment | |  |
| d% | | Alignment of Item | |  |
| 01-05 | | Chaotic good | |  |

<h2 id="special-purpose-items"><a class="header" href="#special-purpose-items">Special Purpose Items</a></h2>
<p>| Intelligent Item Purpose | |  |

| * The purpose of the neutral (N) version of this item is to preserve the balance by defeating/slaying powerful beings of the extreme alignments (LG, LE, CG, CE). | |  |</p>
<h3 id="purpose"><a class="header" href="#purpose">Purpose</a></h3>
<p>An item's purpose must suit the type and alignment of the item and should always be treated reasonably. A purpose of &quot;defeat/slay arcane spellcasters&quot; doesn't mean that the sword forces the wielder to kill every wizard she sees. Nor does it mean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every wizard, sorcerer, and bard in the world. It does mean that the item hates arcane spellcasters and wants to bring the local wizard's cabal to ruin, as well as end the rule of a sorceress-queen in a nearby land. Likewise, a purpose of &quot;defend elves&quot; doesn't mean that if the wielder is an elf, he only wants to help himself. It means that the item wants to be used in furthering the cause of elves, stamping out their enemies and aiding their leaders. A purpose of &quot;defeat/slay all&quot; isn't just a matter of self-preservation. It means that the item won't rest (or let its wielder rest) until it places itself above all others.</p>
<h2 id="dedicated-power"><a class="header" href="#dedicated-power">Dedicated Power</a></h2>
<p>A dedicated power operates only when an intelligent item is in pursuit of its special purpose. This determination is always made by the item. It should always be easy and straightforward to see how the ends justify the means. Unlike its other powers, an intelligent item can refuse to use its dedicated power even if the owner is dominant (see Items against Characters, below).</p>

<h2 id="item-ego"><a class="header" href="#item-ego">Item Ego</a></h2>
<p>Ego is a measure of the total power and force of personality that an item possesses. Only after all aspects of an item have been generated can its Ego score be calculated. An item's Ego score helps determine whether the item or the character is dominant in their relationship, as detailed below.</p>
<p>| Item Ego | |  |
| Attribute of Item | | Ego Points | |  |
| Each +1 of item's enhancement bonus | | 1 | |  |
| Each +1 of bonus for special abilities | | 1 | |  |
| Each lesser power | | 1 | |  |
| Each greater power | | 2 | |  |
| Special purpose (and dedicated power) | | 4 | |  |
| Telepathic ability | | 1 | |  |
| Read languages ability | | 1 | |  |
| Read magic ability | | 1 | |  |
| Each +1 of Intelligence bonus | | 1 | |  |
| Each +1 of Wisdom bonus | | 1 | |  |
| Each +1 of Charisma bonus | | 1 | |  |</p>
<h2 id="items-against-characters"><a class="header" href="#items-against-characters">Items Against Characters</a></h2>
<p>When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is, of course, absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment's goals or the item's special purpose, personality conflict--item against character--results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree with the item.</p>
<p>When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = item's Ego). If the possessor succeeds, she is dominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for one day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, and so on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character's desires and demands concessions such as any of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.</li>
<li>The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.</li>
<li>Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.</li>
<li>Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.</li>
<li>Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation when it is not in use.</li>
<li>That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.</li>
<li>That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.</li>
</ul>
<p>In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as the following acts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Force its possessor into combat.</li>
<li>Refuse to strike opponents.</li>
<li>Strike at its wielder or her associates.</li>
<li>Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.</li>
<li>Cause itself to drop from the character's grasp.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character's and item's alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily establish and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals.</p>
<p>All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are rivals of each other, even if they are of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60 feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract their host so that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior. </p>
<p>Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters who possess them, even though they may never successfully control their possessors. They may be powerless to force their demands but remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and demands.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cursed-items-1"><a class="header" href="#cursed-items-1">Cursed Items</a></h1>
<p>Cursed items are magic items with some sort of potentially negative impact. Sometimes they're directly bad for the user; sometimes they're just inconvenient. Occasionally they mix bad with good, forcing characters to make difficult choices. </p>
<p>| Cursed Item Common Curses | |  |
| d% | | Curse | |  |
| 01-15 | | Delusion | |  |
| 16-35 | | Opposite effect or target | |  |
| 36-45 | | Intermittent functioning | |  |
| 46-60 | | Requirement | |  |
| 61-75 | | Drawback | |  |
| 76-90 | | Completely different effect | |  |
| 91-100 | | Substitute specific cursed item | |  |</p>
<p><strong>Delusion:</strong> The user believes the item is what it appears to be, yet it actually has no magical power other than to deceive. The user is mentally fooled into thinking the item is functioning and cannot be convinced otherwise without the help of a remove curse spell.</p>
<p><strong>Opposite Effect or Target:</strong> These cursed items malfunction, so that either they do the opposite of what the creator intended, or they target the user instead of someone else. The interesting point to keep in mind here is that these items aren't always bad to have. Opposite-effect items include weapons that impose penalties on attack and damage rolls rather than bonuses. Just as a character shouldn't necessarily immediately know what the enhancement bonus of a noncursed magic item is, she shouldn't immediately know that a weapon is cursed. Once she knows, however, the item can be discarded unless some sort of compulsion is placed upon it that compels the wielder to keep and use it. In such cases, a remove curse spell is generally needed to get rid of the item.</p>
<p><strong>Intermittent Functioning:</strong> The three varieties of intermittent functioning items all function perfectly as described--at least some of the time. The three varieties are unreliable, dependent, and uncontrolled items.</p>
<p><strong>Unreliable:</strong> Each time the item is activated, there is a 5% chance (01-05 on d%) that it does not function.</p>
<p><strong>Dependent:</strong> The item only functions in certain situations. To determine what the situation is, either select a situation or roll on the following table.</p>
<p>| d% | | Situation | |  |
| 01-03 | | Temperature below freezing | |  |
| 04-05 | | Temperature above freezing | |  |
| 06-10 | | During the day | |  |
| 11-15 | | During the night | |  |
| 16-20 | | In direct sunlight | |  |
| 21-25 | | Out of direct sunlight | |  |
| 26-34 | | Underwater | |  |
| 35-37 | | Out of water | |  |
| 38-45 | | Underground | |  |
| 46-55 | | Aboveground | |  |
| 56-60 | | Within 10 feet of a random creature type | |  |
| 61-64 | | Within 10 feet of a random race or kind of creature | |  |
| 65-72 | | Within 10 feet of an arcane spellcaster | |  |
| 73-80 | | Within 10 feet of a divine spellcaster | |  |
| 81-85 | | In the hands of a nonspellcaster | |  |
| 86-90 | | In the hands of a spellcaster | |  |
| 91-95 | | In the hands of a creature of a particular alignment | |  |
| 96 | | In the hands of a creature of particular gender | |  |
| 97-99 | | On nonholy days or during particular astrological events | |  |
| 100 | | More than 100 miles from a particular site | |  |</p>
<p><strong>Uncontrolled:</strong> An uncontrolled item occasionally activates at random times. Roll d% every day. On a result of 01-05 the item activates at some random point during that day. </p>
<p><strong>Requirement:</strong> In a sense, a command word is a requirement. Nevertheless, some items have much more stringent requirements that must be met for them to be usable. To keep an item with this kind of curse functioning, one or more of the following conditions must be met.</p>
<ul>
<li>Character must eat twice as much as normal.</li>
<li>Character must sleep twice as much as normal.</li>
<li>Character must undergo a specific quest (one time only, and then item functions normally thereafter).</li>
<li>Character must sacrifice (destroy) 100 gp worth of valuables per day.</li>
<li>Character must sacrifice (destroy) 2,000 gp worth of magic items each week.</li>
<li>Character must swear fealty to a particular noble or his family.</li>
<li>Character must discard all other magic items.</li>
<li>Character must worship a particular deity.</li>
<li>Character must change her name to a specific name. (The item only works for characters of that name.)</li>
<li>Character must add a specific class at the next opportunity if not of that class already.</li>
<li>Character must have a minimum number of ranks in a particular skill.</li>
<li>Character must sacrifice some part of her life energy (2 points of Constitution) one time. If the character gets the Constitution points back (such as from a restoration spell), the item ceases functioning. (The item does not cease functioning if the character receives a Constitution increase caused by level gain, a wish, or the use of a magic item.)</li>
<li>Item must be cleansed with holy water each day.</li>
<li>Item must be used to kill a living creature each day.</li>
<li>Item must be bathed in volcanic lava once per month.</li>
<li>Item must be used at least once a day, or it won't function again for its current possessor.</li>
<li>Item must draw blood when wielded (weapons only). It can't be put away or exchanged for another weapon until it has scored a hit.</li>
<li>Item must have a particular spell cast upon it each day (such as bless, atonement, or animate objects).</li>
</ul>
<p>Requirements are so dependent upon suitability to the item that they should never be determined randomly. An item with a requirement that is also intelligent often imposes its requirement through its personality. If the requirement is not met, the item ceases to function. If it is met, usually the item functions for one day before the requirement must be met again (although some requirements are one time only, others monthly, and still others continuous).</p>
<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Items with drawbacks are usually still beneficial to the possessor but they also carry some negative aspect. Although sometimes drawbacks occur only when the item is used (or held, in the case of some items such as weapons), usually the drawback remains with the character for as long as she has the item.</p>
<p>Roll on the table below to generate a drawback that (unless otherwise indicated) remains in effect as long as the item is in the character's possession.</p>
<p>| d% | | Drawback | |  |
| 01-04 | | Character's hair grows 1 inch longer. Only happens once. | |  |
| 05-09 | | Character either shrinks 1/2 inch (01-50 on d%) or grows that much taller (51-100). Only happens once. | |  |
| 10-13 | | Temperature around item is 10°F cooler than normal. | |  |
| 14-17 | | Temperature around item is 10°F warmer than normal. | |  |
| 18-21 | | Character's hair color changes. | |  |
| 22-25 | | Character's skin color changes. | |  |
| 26-29 | | Character now bears some identifying mark (tattoo, weird glow, or the like). | |  |
| 30-32 | | Character's gender changes. | |  |
| 33-34 | | Character's race or kind changes. | |  |
| 35 | | Character is afflicted with a random disease that cannot be cured. | |  |
| 36-39 | | Item continually emits a disturbing sound (moaning, weeping, screaming, cursing, insults). | |  |
| 40 | | Item looks ridiculous (garishly colored, silly shape, glows bright pink, . . .). | |  |
| 41-45 | | Character becomes selfishly possessive about the item. | |  |
| 46-49 | | Character becomes paranoid about losing the item and afraid of damage occurring to it. | |  |
| 50-51 | | Character's alignment changes. | |  |
| 52-54 | | Character must attack nearest creature (5% chance [01-05 on d%] each day). | |  |
| 55-57 | | Character is stunned for 1d4 rounds once item function is finished (or randomly, 1/day). | |  |
| 58-60 | | Character's vision is blurry (-2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks requiring vision). | |  |
| 61-64 | | Character gains one negative level. | |  |
| 65 | | Character gains two negative levels. | |  |
| 66-70 | | Character must make a Will save each day or take 1 point of Intelligence damage. | |  |
| 71-75 | | Character must make a Will save each day or take 1 point of Wisdom damage. | |  |
| 76-80 | | Character must make a Will save each day or take 1 point of Charisma damage. | |  |
| 81-85 | | Character must make a Fortitude save each day or take 1 point of Constitution damage. | |  |
| 86-90 | | Character must make a Fortitude save each day or take 1 point of Strength damage. | |  |
| 91-95 | | Character must make a Fortitude save each day or take 1 point of Dexterity damage. | |  |
| 96 | | Character is polymorphed into a specific creature (5% chance [01-05 on d%] each day). | |  |
| 97 | | Character cannot cast arcane spells. | |  |
| 98 | | Character cannot cast divine spells. | |  |
| 99 | | Character cannot cast any spells. | |  |
| 100 | | Either pick one of the above that's appropriate or create a drawback specifically for that item. | |  |</p>
<h2 id="specific-cursed-items"><a class="header" href="#specific-cursed-items">Specific Cursed Items</a></h2>
<p>Specific Cursed Items are provided as examples of cursed items. They are given creation prerequisites, should someone want to intentionally create them (although that does not need to be the origin of the item). Note, however, two exceptions: The crystal hypnosis ball and the bag of devouring cannot be created by any known means.</p>
<p>A simple detect magic spell yields a misleading aura and strength, often indicating that the item is a noncursed item of similar sort. An identify spell only has a 1% chance per caster level to reveal a cursed item's true properties, including the cursed aspect. Analyze dweomer reveals the true nature of a cursed item.</p>

<p><strong>Amulet of Inescapable Location:</strong> This device is typically worn on a chain or as a brooch. It appears, to magical analysis, to prevent location, scrying or detection or influence by detect thoughts or telepathy. It seems to be an amulet of proof against detection and location. Actually, the amulet gives the wearer a -10 penalty on all saves against divination spells.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item, bestow curse; Price 1,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Armor of Arrow Attraction:</strong> Magical analysis indicates that this armor is a normal suit of +3 full plate. However, the armor is cursed. It works normally with regard to melee attacks but actually serves to attract ranged weapons. The wearer takes a -15 penalty to AC against any attack by a ranged weapon. The true nature of the armor does not reveal itself until the character is fired upon in earnest.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bestow curse; Price 9,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Armor of Rage:</strong> This armor is similar in appearance to armor of command and functions as a suit of +1 full plate. However, when it is worn, the armor causes the character to take a -4 penalty to Charisma. All unfriendly characters within 300 feet have a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against her. The effect is not noticeable to the wearer or those affected. (In other words, the wearer does not immediately notice that donning the armor is the cause of her problems, nor do foes understand the reason for the depth of their enmity.)</p>
<p>Strong necromancy; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bestow curse; Price 1,600 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Bag of Devouring:</strong> This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties makes it seem as if it were a bag of holding. The sack is, however, a lure used by an extradimensional creature--in fact, one of its feeding orifices.</p>
<p>Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to &quot;swallowing'' if thrust within the bag. The bag of devouring is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but any time thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending member and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on grapple checks made to pull someone in.</p>
<p>The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a bag of holding type I, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 17th; In effect, this is a creature and cannot be created; Price n/a.</p>
<p><strong>Boots of Dancing:</strong> These boots initially appear and function as one of the other kinds of magic boots. But when the wearer is in (or fleeing from) melee combat, boots of dancing impede movement, making him behave as if irresistible dance had been cast upon him. Only a remove curse spell enables the wearer to be rid of the boots once their true nature is revealed.</p>
<p>Strong enchantment; CL 16th; Create Wondrous Item, irresistible dance; Price 30,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Bracers of Defenselessness:</strong> These appear to be bracers of armor +5 and actually serve as such until the wearer is attacked in anger by an enemy with a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than her level. At that moment and thereafter, the bracers cause a -5 penalty to AC. Once their curse is activated, bracers of defenselessness can be removed only by means of a remove curse spell.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 16th; Create Wondrous Item, mage armor, bestow curse; Price 1,200 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Broom of Animated Attack:</strong> This item is indistinguishable in appearance from a normal broom. It is identical to a broom of flying by all tests short of attempted use.</p>
<p>If a command is spoken, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on his head from 1d4+5 feet off the ground (no falling damage, since the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks the victim, swatting the face with the straw or twig end and beating him with the handle end.</p>
<p>The broom gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw and two with the handle, for a total of four attacks per round). It attacks with a +5 bonus on each attack roll. The straw end causes a victim to be blinded for 1 round when it hits. The handle deals 1d6 points of damage when it hits. The broom has AC 13, 18 hit points, and hardness 4.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item, fly, animate objects; Price 5,200 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Cloak of Poisonousness:</strong> This cloak is usually made of a woolen material, although it can be made of leather. A detect poison spell can reveal the presence of poison impregnated in the cloak's fabric. The garment can be handled without harm, but as soon as it is actually donned the wearer is killed instantly unless she succeeds on a DC 28 Fortitude save.</p>
<p>Once donned, a cloak of poisonousness can be removed only with a remove curse spell; doing this destroys the magical property of the cloak. If a neutralize poison spell is then used, it is possible to revive the victim with a raise dead or resurrection spell, but not before.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 15th; Create Wondrous Item, poison, and limited wish or miracle; Price 62,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Crystal Hypnosis Ball:</strong> This cursed item is indistinguishable from a normal crystal ball. However, anyone attempting to use the scrying device becomes fascinated for 1d6 minutes, and a telepathic suggestion is implanted in his mind (Will DC 19 negates).</p>
<p>The user of the device believes that the desired creature or scene was viewed, but actually he came under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some power or being from another plane. Each further use brings the crystal hypnosis ball gazer deeper under the influence of the controller, either as a servant or a tool. Note that throughout this time, the user remains unaware of his subjugation.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 17th; In effect, this is a minor artifact and cannot be created; Price n/a.</p>
<p><strong>Dust of Sneezing and Choking:</strong> This fine dust appears to be dust of appearance. If cast into the air, it causes those within a 20- foot spread to fall into fits of sneezing and coughing. Those failing a DC 15 Fortitude save take 2d6 points of Constitution damage immediately. In addition, those failing a second DC 15 Fortitude save 1 minute later are dealt 1d6 points of Constitution damage. Those who succeed on either saving throw are nonetheless disabled by choking (treat as stunned) for 5d4 rounds.</p>
<p>Faint conjuration; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, poison; Price 2,400 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Flask of Curses:</strong> This item looks like an ordinary beaker, bottle, container, decanter, flask, or jug. It may contain a liquid, or it may emit smoke. When the flask is first unstoppered, all within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will save or be cursed, taking a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until a remove curse spell is cast upon them.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, bestow curse; Price 2,100 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Gauntlets of Fumbling:</strong> These gauntlets may be of supple leather or heavy protective material suitable for use with armor. In the former instance, they appear to be gloves of Dexterity. In the latter case, they appear to be gauntlets of ogre power. The gauntlets perform according to every test as if they were gloves of Dexterity or gauntlets of ogre power until the wearer finds herself under attack or in a life-and-death situation. At that time, the curse is activated. The wearer becomes fumble-fingered, with a 50% chance each round of dropping anything held in either hand. The gauntlets also lower Dexterity by 2 points. Once the curse is activated, the gloves can be removed only by means of a remove curse spell, a wish, or a miracle.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, bestow curse; Price 1,300 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Helm of Opposite Alignment:</strong> This metal hat looks like a typical helmet. When placed upon the head, however, its curse immediately takes effect (Will DC 15 negates). On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically altered to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignment--good to evil, chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is required. The curse only works once; that is, a character whose alignment has been changed cannot change it again by donning the helmet a second time.</p>
<p>Only a wish or a miracle can restore former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. (In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible.) If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an atonement spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a helm of opposite alignment has functioned once, it loses its magical properties.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Create Wondrous Item, creator must be 12th level; Price 4,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Incense of Obsession:</strong> These blocks of incense appear to be incense of meditation. If meditation and prayer are conducted while incense of obsession is burning nearby, its odor and smoke cause the user to become totally confident that her spell ability is superior, due to the magic incense. The user is determined to use her spells at every opportunity, even when not needed or when useless. The user remains obsessed with her abilities and spells until all have been used or cast, or until 24 hours have elapsed.</p>
<p>Moderate enchantment; CL 6th; Create Wondrous Item, bestow curse; Price 200 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Mace of Blood:</strong> This +3 heavy mace must be coated in blood every day, or its bonus fades away (until the mace is coated again). The character using this mace must make a DC 13 Will save every day it is within his possession or become chaotic evil.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be at least 9th level and chaotic evil; Price 16,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Medallion of Thought Projection:</strong> This device seems like a medallion of thoughts, even down to the range at which it functions, except that the thoughts overheard are muffled and distorted, requiring a DC 15 Will save to sort out. However, while the user thinks she is picking up the thoughts of others, all she is really hearing are figments created by the medallion itself. These illusory thoughts always seem plausible and thus can seriously mislead any who rely upon them. What's worse, unknown to her, the cursed medallion actually broadcasts her thoughts to creatures in the path of the beam, thus alerting them to her presence.</p>
<p>Faint divination; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, ghost sound; Price 1,800 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Necklace of Strangulation:</strong> A necklace of strangulation appears to be a rare and wondrous piece of valuable jewelry and, short of the use of something as powerful as a miracle or a wish, can only be identified as a cursed item when placed around a character's neck. The necklace immediately constricts, dealing 6 points of damage per round. It cannot be removed by any means short of a limited wish, wish, or miracle and remains clasped around the victim's throat even after his death. Only when he has decayed to a dry skeleton (after approximately one month) does the necklace loosen, ready for another victim.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 18th; Create Wondrous Item, slay living; Price 60,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Net of Snaring:</strong> This net provides a +3 bonus on attack rolls but can only be used underwater, thus making it a somewhat useful item rather than what most would really call a cursed item. Underwater, it can be commanded to shoot forth up to 30 feet to trap a creature.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, freedom of movement; Price 10,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Periapt of Foul Rotting:</strong> This engraved gem appears to be of little value. If any character keeps the periapt in her possession for more than 24 hours, she contracts a terrible rotting affliction that permanently drains 1 point of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be removed only by application of a remove curse spell followed by a cure disease and then a heal, miracle, limited wish, or wish spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a periapt of health and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character (a full-round action), whereupon the periapt of foul rotting likewise crumbles to dust.</p>
<p>Faint abjuration; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item, contagion; Price 17,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Potion of Poison:</strong> This potion has lost its once beneficial magical abilities and has become a potent poison. The imbiber must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d10 points of Constitution damage. A minute later he must save again (DC 16) or take 1d10 points of Constitution damage.</p>
<p>Moderate conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, poison; Price 5,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Robe of Powerlessness:</strong> A robe of powerlessness appears to be a magic robe of another sort. As soon as a character dons this garment, she takes a -10 penalty to Strength and Intelligence, forgetting spells and magic knowledge accordingly. The robe can be removed easily, but in order to restore mind and body, the character must receive a remove curse spell followed by heal.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 13th; Create Wondrous Item, bestow curse, permanency; Price 5,500 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Robe of Vermin:</strong> The wearer notices nothing unusual when the robe is donned, other than that it offers great magical defense (as a cloak of protection +4). However, as soon as he is in a situation requiring concentration and action against hostile opponents, the true nature of the garment is revealed: The wearer immediately suffers a multitude of bites from the insects that magically infest the garment. He must cease all other activities in order to scratch, shift the robe, and generally show signs of the extreme discomfort caused by the bites and movement of these pests.</p>
<p>The wearer takes a -5 penalty on initiative checks and a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks. If he tries to cast a spell, he must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose the spell.</p>
<p>Moderate abjuration; CL 13th; Create Wondrous Item, summon swarm, creator must be at least 13th level; Price 16,500 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Ring of Clumsiness:</strong> This ring operates exactly like a ring of feather falling. However, it also makes the wearer clumsy. She takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity and has a 20% chance of spell failure when trying to cast any arcane spell that has a somatic component. (This chance of spell failure stacks with other arcane spell failure chances.)</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Forge Ring, feather fall, bestow curse; Price 500 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Scarab of Death:</strong> This small pin appears to be any one of the various beneficial amulets, brooches, or scarabs. However, if it is held for more than 1 round or carried by a living creature for 1 minute, it changes into a horrible burrowing beetlelike creature. The thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows into flesh, and reaches the victim's heart in 1 round, causing death. A DC 25 Reflex save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight, but he still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab form. Placing the scarab in a container of wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal prevents the monster from coming to life and allows for long-term storage of the item.</p>
<p>Strong abjuration; CL 19th; Create Wondrous Item, slay living; Price 80,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Spear, Cursed Backbiter:</strong> This is a +2 shortspear, but each time it is used in melee against a foe and the attack roll is a natural 1, it damages its wielder instead of her intended target. When the curse takes effect, the spear curls around to strike its wielder in the back, automatically dealing the damage to the wielder. The curse even functions when the spear is hurled, and in such a case the damage to the hurler is doubled.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bestow curse; Price 7,500 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Stone of Weight (Loadstone):</strong> This stone appears to be a dark, smoothly polished stone. It reduces the possessor's base land speed to one-half of normal. Once picked up, the stone cannot be disposed of by any nonmagical means--if it is thrown away or smashed, it reappears somewhere on his person. If a remove curse spell is cast upon a loadstone, the item may be discarded normally and no longer haunts the individual.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Create Wondrous Item, slow; Price 1,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>-2 Sword, Cursed:</strong> This longsword performs well against targets in practice, but when used against an opponent in combat, it causes its wielder to take a -2 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
<p>All damage dealt is also reduced by 2 points, but never below a minimum of 1 point of damage on any successful hit. After one week in a character's possession, the sword always forces that character to employ it rather than another weapon. The sword's owner automatically draws it and fights with it even when she meant to draw or ready some other weapon. The sword can be gotten rid of only by means of limited wish, wish, or miracle.</p>
<p>Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bestow curse, and limited wish or miracle; Price 1,500 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Sword, Berserking:</strong> This item appears to have the characteristics of a +2 greatsword. However, whenever the sword is used in battle, its wielder goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian's rage ability). He attacks the nearest creature and continues to fight until unconscious or dead or until no living thing remains within 30 feet. Although many see this sword as a cursed object, others see it as a boon.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, rage, bestow curse; Price 17,500 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Vacuous Grimoire:</strong> A book of this sort looks like a normal one on some mildly interesting topic. Any character who opens the work and reads so much as a single word therein must make two DC 15 Will saves. The first is to determine if the reader takes 1 point of permanent Intelligence drain. The second is to find out if the reader takes 2 points of permanent Wisdom drain. To destroy the book, a character must burn it while casting remove curse. If the grimoire is placed with other books, its appearance instantly alters to conform to the look of those other works.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="artifacts"><a class="header" href="#artifacts">Artifacts</a></h1>
<p>Artifacts are extremely powerful. Rather than merely another form of magic equipment, they are the sorts of legendary relics that whole campaigns can be based on. Each could be the center of a whole set of adventures--a quest to recover it, a fight against a opponent wielding it, a mission to cause its destruction, and so on.</p>
<p>No table has been included to randomly generate specific artifacts, since these items should only enter a campaign through deliberate choice on your part.</p>
<h2 id="minor-artifacts"><a class="header" href="#minor-artifacts">Minor Artifacts</a></h2>
<p>Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they are magic items that no longer can be created, at least by common mortal means.</p>
<h3 id="minor-artifact-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#minor-artifact-descriptions">Minor Artifact Descriptions</a></h3>
<p>Described below is a selection of the most well-known (not necessarily the most numerous) minor artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>Book of Infinite Spells:</strong> This work bestows upon any character of any class the ability to use the spells within its pages. However, any character not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she uses its power. A book of infinite spells contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a dice roll: 01-50, arcane spell; 51-100, divine spell.</p>
<p>Determine the exact spell by using the tables for determining major scroll spells.</p>
<p>Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back--paging through a book of infinite spells is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes.</p>
<p>Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be copied into a spellbook--their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself.</p>
<p>The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power. The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power.</p>
<p>Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The owner knows this and may even benefit from the turning by gaining access to a new spell. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is.</p>
<p>| Condition | | Chance of Page Turning | |  |
| Caster employing a spell usable by own class and level | | 10% | |  |
| Caster employing a spell not usable by own class and level | | 20% | |  |
| Nonspellcaster employing divine spell | | 25% | |  |
| Nonspellcaster employing arcane spell | | 30% | |  |
Treat each spell use as if a scroll were being employed, for purposes of determining casting time, spell failure, and so on.</p>
<p>Strong (all schools); CL 18th; Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Deck of Many Things:</strong> A deck of many things (both beneficial and baneful) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.</p>
<p>The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never again draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. Exception: If the jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw two additional cards.</p>
<p>Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the jester or the fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are fully described below.</p>
<p>| Deck of Many Things | |  |
| Plaque | Tarot Card | Playing Card | Summary of Effect | |  |
| Balance | XI. Justice | Two of spades | Change alignment instantly. | |  |
| Comet | Two of swords | Two of diamonds | Defeat the next monster you meet to gain one level. | |  |
| Donjon | Four of swords | Ace of spades | You are imprisoned. | |  |
| Euryale | Ten of swords | Queen of spades | -1 penalty on all saving throws henceforth. | |  |
| The Fates | Three of cups | Ace of hearts | Avoid any situation you choose . . . once. | |  |
| Flames | XV. The Devil | Queen of clubs | Enmity between you and an outsider. | |  |
| Fool | 0. The Fool | Joker (with trademark) | Lose 10,000 experience points and you must draw again. | |  |
| Gem | Seven of cups | Two of hearts | Gain your choice of twenty-five pieces of jewelry or fifty gems. | |  |
| Idiot | Two of pentacles | Two of clubs | Lose Intelligence (permanent drain). You may draw again. | |  |
| Jester | XII. The Hanged Man | Joker (without trademark) | Gain 10,000 XP or two more draws from the deck. | |  |
| Key | V. The Hierophant | Queen of hearts | Gain a major magic weapon. | |  |
| Knight | Page of swords | Jack of hearts | Gain the service of a 4th-level fighter. | |  |
| Moon | XVIII. The Moon | Queen of diamonds | You are granted 1d4 wishes. | |  |
| Rogue | Five of swords | Jack of spades | One of your friends turns against you. | |  |
| Ruin | XVI. The Tower | King of spades | Immediately lose all wealth and real property. | |  |
| Skull | XIII. Death | Jack of clubs | Defeat dread wraith or be forever destroyed. | |  |

| Sun | XIX. The Sun | King of diamonds | Gain beneficial medium wondrous item and 50,000 XP. | |  |
| Talons | Queen of pentacles | Ace of clubs | All magic items you possess disappear permanently. | |  |

| The Void | Eight of swords | King of clubs | Body functions, but soul is trapped elsewhere. | |  |</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balance:</strong> The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level.</li>
<li><strong>Comet:</strong> The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level.</li>
<li><strong>Donjon:</strong> This card signifies imprisonment-- either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards.</li>
<li><strong>Euryale:</strong> The medusalike visage of this card brings a curse that only the fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent.</li>
<li><strong>Fates:</strong> This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation.</li>
<li><strong>Flames:</strong> Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days.</li>
<li><strong>Fool:</strong> The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the jester.</li>
<li><strong>Gem:</strong> This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, the gems 1,000 gp value each. </li>
<li><strong>Idiot:</strong> This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional.</li>
<li><strong>Jester:</strong> This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the fool. The redraws are optional.</li>
<li><strong>Key:</strong> The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand.</li>
<li><strong>Knight:</strong> The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character.</li>
<li><strong>Moon:</strong> This card sometimes bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received.</li>
<li><strong>Rogue:</strong> When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and forever after hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.</li>
<li><strong>Ruin:</strong> As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost.</li>
<li><strong>Skull:</strong> A dread wraith appears. Treat this creature as an unturnable undead. The character must fight it alone--if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle.</li>
<li><strong>Star:</strong> The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities. </li>
<li><strong>Sun:</strong> Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated.</li>
<li><strong>Talons:</strong> When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably gone.</li>
<li><strong>Throne:</strong> The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour).</li>
<li><strong>Vizier:</strong> This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within one year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another question entirely.</li>
<li><strong>The Void:</strong> This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere--in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strong (all schools); CL 20th.</p>
<p><strong>Hammer of Thunderbolts:</strong> This +3 Large returning warhammer deals 4d6 points of damage on any hit. Further, if the wielder wears a belt of giant Strength and gauntlets of ogre power and he knows that the hammer is a hammer of thunderbolts (not just a +3 warhammer), the weapon can be used to full effect: It gains a total +5 enhancement bonus, allows all belt and gauntlet bonuses to stack (only when using this weapon), and strikes dead any giant upon whom it scores a hit (Fortitude DC 20 negates the death effect but not the damage).</p>
<p>When hurled, on a successful attack the hammer emits a great noise, like a clap of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 negates). The hammer's range increment is 30 feet.</p>
<p>Strong evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; CL 20th; Weight 15 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Philosopher's Stone:</strong> This rare substance appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish rock. If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone's heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any arcane spellcaster to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher's stone can turn from up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver, or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold. However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.</p>
<p>The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a true resurrection spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 20th; Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Sphere of Annihilation:</strong> A sphere of annihilation is a globe of absolute blackness, a ball of nothingness 2 feet in diameter. The object is actually a hole in the continuity of the multiverse. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.</p>
<p>A sphere of annihilation is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.</p>
<p>Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet +5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30.</p>
<p>If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it.</p>
<p>If two or more creatures vie for control of a sphere of annihilation, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.</p>
<p>Should a gate spell be cast upon a sphere of annihilation, there is a 50% chance (01-50 on d%) that the spell destroys it, a 35% chance (51-85) that the spell does nothing, and a 15% chance (86-100) that a gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything within a 180-foot radius into another plane. If a rod of cancellation touches a sphere of annihilation, they negate each other in a tremendous explosion. Everything within a 60-foot radius takes 2d6x10 points of damage. Dispel magic and mage's disjunction have no effect on a sphere.</p>
<p>See also talisman of the sphere (below).</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 20th.</p>
<p><strong>Staff of the Magi:</strong> A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers and other functions. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. The following powers do not use charges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect magic</li>
<li>Enlarge person (Fortitude DC 15 negates)</li>
<li>Hold portal</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Mage armor</li>
<li>Mage hand</li>
</ul>
<p>The following powers drain 1 charge per usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dispel magic</li>
<li>Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half )</li>
<li>Ice storm</li>
<li>Invisibility</li>
<li>Knock</li>
<li>Lightning bolt (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half )</li>
<li>Passwall</li>
<li>Pyrotechnics (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates)</li>
<li>Wall of fire</li>
<li>Web</li>
</ul>
<p>These powers drain 2 charges per usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monster summoning IX</li>
<li>Plane shift (Will DC 21 negates)</li>
<li>Telekinesis (400 lb. maximum weight; Will DC 19 negates)</li>
</ul>
<p>A staff of the magi gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. (Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.)</p>
<p>Retributive Strike: A staff of the magi can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take hit points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 17 Reflex save reduces damage by half. </p>
<p>The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance (01-50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but if she does not (51-100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her. Only specific items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of power are capable of a retributive strike.</p>
<p>Strong (all schools); CL 20th;Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Talisman of Pure Good:</strong> A good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who possesses this item can cause a flaming crack to open at the feet of an evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be good, and if he is not exceptionally pure in thought and deed the evil character gains a DC 19 Reflex saving throw to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function. </p>
<p>A talisman of pure good has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, he takes 6d6 points of damage. If an evil divine spellcaster touches one, he takes 8d6 points of damage. All other characters are unaffected by the device.</p>
<p>Strong evocation [good]; CL 18th.</p>
<p><strong>Talisman of the Sphere:</strong> This small adamantine loop and handle are useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters</p>
<p>who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a sphere of annihilation, a talisman of the sphere doubles the character's modifier on his control check (doubling both his Intelligence bonus and his character level for this purpose).</p>
<p>If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he need check for maintaining control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have no effect upon a sphere of annihilation, the talisman's power of control can be suppressed or canceled.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 16th;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Talisman of Reluctant Wishes:</strong> A talisman of this sort appears the same as a stone of controlling earth elementals. Its powers are quite different, however, and dependent on the Charisma of the individual holding the talisman. Whenever a character touches a talisman of reluctant wishes, he must make a DC 15 Charisma check. </p>
<p>If he fails, the device acts as a stone of weight. Discarding or destroying it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman. </p>
<p>If he succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a wish is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.</p>
<p>If he rolls a natural 20, the character finds it impossible to be rid of the talisman for as many months as he has points of Charisma. In addition, the artifact grants him one wish for every 6 points of the character's Charisma. It also grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)</p>
<p>Regardless of which reaction results, a talisman of reluctant wishes disappears when its time period expires, leaving behind a 10,000 gp diamond in its stead.</p>
<p>Strong conjuration; CL 20th; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Talisman of Ultimate Evil:</strong> An evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who possesses this item can cause a flaming crack to open at the feet of a good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be evil, and if she is not exceptionally foul and perverse in the sights of her evil deity the good character gains a DC 19 Reflex save to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function. </p>
<p>A talisman of ultimate evil has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, she takes 6d6 points of damage. If a good divine spellcaster touches one, she takes 8d6 points of damage. All other characters are unaffected by the device. </p>
<p>Strong evocation [evil]; CL 18th.</p>
<h2 id="major-artifacts"><a class="header" href="#major-artifacts">Major Artifacts</a></h2>
<p>Major artifacts are unique items--only one of each such item exists. These are the most potent of magic items, capable of altering the balance of a campaign.</p>
<p>Unlike all other magic items, major artifacts are not easily destroyed. Each should have only a single, specific means of destruction.</p>
<h3 id="major-artifact-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#major-artifact-descriptions">Major Artifact Descriptions</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Moaning Diamond:</strong> The Moaning Diamond appears to be an uncut diamond the size of a human fist. At all times, it gives forth a baleful moaning sound, as if in pain. Despite the noise, the Moaning Diamond is not evil. The wielder of the stone can, three times per day, call upon it to reshape earth and stone as if by the spell stone shape, affecting 5,000 cubic feet of material. The Moaning Diamond can summon an elder earth elemental with maximum hit points that serves the caster until it is slain. Only one such elemental can be summoned at a time; if it is slain, a new creature cannot be summoned for 24 hours. </p>
<p><strong>The Orbs of Dragonkind:</strong> Each of these fabled orbs contains the essence and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an Orb can dominate dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as dominate monster), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. (Spell resistance is not useful against this effect.) Each Orb of Dragonkind bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the Orb. A character possessing an Orb of Dragonkind is immune to the breath weapon--but only the breath weapon--of the dragon variety keyed to the Orb. Finally, a character possessing an Orb can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the Orb three times per day.</p>
<p>All Orbs of Dragonkind can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other Orbs. The owner of an Orb knows whether there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the Orb's particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the Orb's variety, the wielder can determine the exact location and age of the creature. The bearer of one of these Orbs earns the enmity forever of all dragonkind for profiting by the enslavement of one of their kin, even if she later loses the item. </p>
<p>Each Orb also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at 10th caster level.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Black Dragon Orb:</strong> Fly (Will DC 17 negates).</li>
<li><strong>Blue Dragon Orb:</strong> Haste (Fortitude DC 17 negates).</li>
<li><strong>Brass Dragon Orb:</strong> Teleport (Will DC 19 negates).</li>
<li><strong>Bronze Dragon Orb:</strong> Scrying (Will DC 18 negates).</li>
<li><strong>Copper Dragon Orb:</strong> Suggestion (Will DC 17 negates).</li>
<li><strong>Gold Dragon Orb:</strong> The owner of the gold Orb can call upon any power possessed by one of the other Orbs--including the dominate and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity--but can only use an individual power once per day. She can use dominate on any other possessor of an Orb within 1 mile (Will DC 23 negates).</li>
<li><strong>Green Dragon Orb:</strong> Spectral hand.</li>
<li><strong>Red Dragon Orb:</strong> Wall of fire.</li>
<li><strong>Silver Dragon Orb:</strong> Cure critical wounds (Will DC 18 half ).</li>
<li><strong>White Dragon Orb:</strong> Protection from energy (cold) (Fortitude DC 17 negates).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Saint's Mace: This relic appears to be a simple, well-used cudgel, but its simple appearance hides great power. The saint's mace has a +5 enhancement bonus and functions as a heavy mace with the holy, lawful, and disruption special abilities. The wielder can project searing light from the mace at will, at caster level 20th.</p>
<p><strong>The Shadowstaff:</strong> This artifact was crafted centuries ago, weaving together the wispy strands of shadow itself into a twisted black staff. The Shadowstaff makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. </p>
<p>The Shadowstaff also has these powers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summon Shadows:</strong> Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a summon monster V spell cast at 20th level.</li>
<li><strong>Summon Nightshade:</strong> Once per month, the staff can summon a nightcrawler nightshade that serves the wielder as if called by a summon monster IX spell cast at 20th level.</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Form:</strong> Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by the gaseous form spell. </li>
<li><strong>Shadow Bolt:</strong> Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Shield of the Sun:</strong> This +5 large shield, emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level paladin with a Wisdom score of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day that the character might have, even if she's already a paladin. The Shield of the Sun also grants spell resistance 15 to its wielder. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a quest (no saving throw to avoid) at the behest of a lawful good deity. </p>
<p>A character who is evil or chaotic (LE, NE, CE, CN, CG) gains four negative levels if she attempts to use this artifact. Although these negative levels never results in actual level loss, they remain as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer's possession.</p>
