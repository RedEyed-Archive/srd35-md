# Introduction

This is the System Reference Document v3.5,
converted from the original RTF files into Markdown.
The bulk of the conversion work was done programmatically.
After that, fixes were applied by hand.

While the content is organized into more pages than the base RTF files,
there are not any *intentional* rules differences between this markdown version and the official RTF version.
However, typos and errors are always possible.

If you notice any problems please [file an issue](https://github.com/Lokathor/srd35-md/issues).
