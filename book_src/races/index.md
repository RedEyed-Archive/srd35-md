# Races 

## Favored Class

A character's favored class doesn't count against him or her when determining experience point penalties for multiclassing. 

## Race and Languages

All characters know how to speak Common. A dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, or halfling also speaks a racial language, as appropriate. A character who has an Intelligence bonus at 1st level speaks other languages as well, one extra language per point of Intelligence bonus as a starting character. 

**Literacy:** Any character except a barbarian can read and write all the languages he or she speaks.

**Class-Related Languages:** Clerics, druids, and wizards can choose certain languages as bonus languages even if they're not on the lists found in the race descriptions. These class-related languages are as follows:
* Cleric: Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal.
* Druid: Sylvan.
* Wizard: Draconic.

## Small Characters

A Small character gets a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. A Small character's carrying capacity is three-quarters of that of a Medium character.

A Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as a Medium character.

A Small character must use smaller weapons than a Medium character.
