# Balance (Dex; Armor Check Penalty)

**Check:** You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can't move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface, as follows:

| Narrow Surface          | Balance DC<sup>1</sup> | Difficult Surface      | Balance DC<sup>1</sup> |
|:----------------------- |:----------------------:|:---------------------- |:----------------------:|
| 7-12 inches wide        |           10           | Uneven flagstone       |     10<sup>2</sup>     |
| 2-6 inches wide         |           15           | Hewn stone floor       |     10<sup>2</sup>     |
| Less than 2 inches wide |           20           | Sloped or angled floor |     10<sup>2</sup>     |

1) Add modifiers from Narrow Surface Modifiers, below, as appropriate.
2) Only if running or charging. Failure by 4 or less means the character can't run or charge, but may otherwise act normally.

Narrow Surface Modifiers (These modifiers stack)

| Surface             | DC Modifier<sup>1</sup> |
|:------------------- |:-----------------------:|
| Lightly obstructed  |           +2            |
| Severely obstructed |           +5            |
| Lightly slippery    |           +2            |
| Severely slippery   |           +5            |
| Sloped or angled    |           +2            |

1) Add the appropriate modifier to the Balance DC of a narrow surface.

**Being Attacked while Balancing:** You are considered flat-footed while balancing, since you can't move to avoid a blow, and thus you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you aren't considered flat-footed while balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Balance check against the same DC to remain standing.

**Accelerated Movement:** You can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a -5 penalty, you can move your full speed as a move action. (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each move action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to charge across a precarious surface; charging requires one Balance check for each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof ) that you charge.

**Action:** None. A Balance check doesn't require an action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.

**Special:** If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.

**Synergy:** If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.
